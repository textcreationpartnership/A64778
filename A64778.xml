            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,

            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

               <p>HOW glad I am to ſee you, my dear Nephew (cried <hi>Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rante,</hi> in embracing <hi>Liſidor</hi>) and how farther joyful ſhould I be, could I prove ſerviceable to you in this Town?</p>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Liſidor.</speaker>
                  <p>You know, Sir, the reaſon of my coming, was becauſe you was here, and that had it not
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:46351:7"/>been for this, thoſe that have the care of me, would never have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented to this journey.</p>
                  <p>After theſe words <hi>Dorante</hi> made <hi>Liſidor</hi> enter into an <hi>Apartment</hi> he had provided for him, and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving ordered the Collation to be brought in, he deſired him to ſit down, and thus continued the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Dorante.</speaker>
                  <p>I do not at all won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, you have ſo greatly deſired to come into this Town. All young people deſire the ſame; for one may ſay, that <hi>Paris</hi> is not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the Capital of a ſlouriſhing Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchy, but is even reſpected as the predominant City of all <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rope.</hi> People come here from all parts, ſome to poliſh themſelves, others to get Employments, others to ſee the fineſt Court in the World, and the greateſt King on Earth. However, to be well acquainted with <hi>Paris</hi> requires time: Stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers are ſurpriſed in not finding
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:46351:7"/>immediately all the varieties they have been told of it; they ſeek them, and diſcover only the leaſt part of them, as long as they ſee only the Streets and Buildings.</p>
                  <p>But how great is their admira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion afterwards, when they enter into the Houſes, and view the mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nificence of the Furniture? If they be admitted into the Company of Perſons of wit and merit which at certain hours meet together?</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Liſidor.</speaker>
                  <p>I profeſs, Sir, that I love <hi>Paris</hi> the more for that rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, and above all things wiſh I were capable of making one in theſe Converſations; but I am ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible how unfit I am for it. I want natural parts to ſecond the care you will take of me.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Dorante.</speaker>
                  <p>You have no reaſon to complain againſt Nature, you have been better uſed by her than I ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect you will tell me; and were
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:46351:8"/>I as able, as ſhe has been favou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable to you, my Counſels, and your Talents would make you go very faſt and far in the way you deſire to enter. However, I doubt not of the ſucceſs, notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the ſmallneſs of my aſſiſtance.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Liſidor.</speaker>
                  <p>I know, Sir, how great a Maſter you are in the Art I would learn; and all the World knows that your Age, which has yielded you Experience, has taken no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing from you of that agreeable<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, which makes the Charms of Converſation.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Dorante.</speaker>
                  <p>As I am naturally com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaiſant, and that I love compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, you may hear ſomething in my commendation, and therefore I ſhall not by an unfeaſonable modeſty oppoſe my Friends opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of me, ſeeing it may make you to receive the advice I am deſired to give you with greater reliſh. It is at your Father's requeſt, Sir, that I have undertaken this Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince,
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:46351:8"/>who is the deareſt of my Relations, and therefore you may eaſily imagine I ſhall uſe my ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt endeavours to ſatisfie both you and him. I much approve of your deſign; for nothing is more important in the commerce of life, than to pleaſe in Converſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; and if men are born for So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety, one may ſay that it is Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation which is the Bond of Friendſhip. But I know not if be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we enter into matters which we ſhould treat of, I ſhould not ask you what you underſtand by the word Converſation?</p>

                  <speaker>Liſidor.</speaker>
                  <p>I am not at all diſplea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, Sir, you ask me this, ſeeing it will coſt you an explication; for I confeſs, that although I compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend what a Converſation is, yet I ſhould be perplex'd, ſhould you require a proper definition of it.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Dorante.</speaker>
                  <p>I am not at all ſurpri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed at what you ſay; I have ſeen in the ſame pain, perſons more ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perienc'd
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:46351:9"/>than you can be at your age. There are a great many diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions to make hereupon, and eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry time ſeveral perſons ſpeak in theſe Aſſemblies, they form not what we call Converſation. Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcure Sciences and great Affairs muſt have a leſs ſhare in their diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſes, than agreeableneſs and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion. For in fine, let a man treat gravely of important mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, in a Council of State or War, in a Low-ſuit or Diſtemper; where a Phyſician ſhall banter you with hard words, and a Lawyer cramp you with Preſidents; all this is no more a Converſation, than the Brawlings in publick di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſputes, or the Scoldings of Fiſh Women.</p>

                  <p>So far am I from ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhing the ſubjects you ſpeak of,
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:46351:9"/>that I affirm they ſerve to uphold Converſation, and to render it more inſtructive. The Palace, or pleading places, have now and then ſuch Cauſes as furniſh the beſt Companies with entertainment. There are great Subornations, conteſted Marriages, and Divorces, which give occaſion to ſome to Moralize, and to others to utter a thouſand witty Reflections. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever a man would prove very troubleſom, if, to make himſelf admired, he ſhould enter on par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulariſing an important Subject, and diſcourſe of nothing elſe all the day long. It is variety which makes any thing agreeable, an air eaſie and remote from affectation, which is never tireſom; whereas ſhould a man diſcourſe on a ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lime Subject with affected expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, you could not hearken long to him, without falling aſleep. Yet great intereſts, and extraordinary events may find their place in moſt
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:46351:10"/>Converſations; provided they en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter naturally, and be treated of with that capacity and modeſty they require. Particularly one is aſſured to pleaſe, if there be News wanting, and you be the firſt that relates a conſiderable Marriage, the birth of a Prince, the gaining of a Battel, or the taking of a place. Men are generally pleaſed at the recital of Regulations which relate to the Peoples welfare, or the beautifying of Towns, and For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifying of places. Add that we hearken with pleaſure to one who comes from Court, if ſhe deſcribes a magnificent Entertainment, or a Faſhion that is not as yet known in Town. Yet thoſe recitals muſt not be long, the particulars muſt only be toucht on, wherein the chief of the company may be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern'd; and the moſt important advice I can give you, is to conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der always before whom you ſpeak. Without this precaution
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:46351:10"/>you'll be in danger of offending Perſons whom you would pleaſe; and therefore if you will believe me, you will never act the Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſopher before young People, who deſire only to talk of Plays and fine Women; neither muſt you ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear ſevere in a Ball before Ladies, who think of nothing but dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing and diverting themſelves. In fine, you muſt conſult Reaſon, which being your guide, I ſee few matters, but may be Subjects of Converſation. It's true one ought to ſpeak leſs of ones ſelf than any thing elſe. For what can we ſay of ourſelves? We ſhall make our ſelves ridiculous in diſplaying the good qualities we poſſeſs. And can we have the imprudence to publiſh our defects? or ſhall we deaden the Entertainment in ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing indifferent and ordinary things of our ſelves? Extend this Rule, if you pleaſe, to Domeſticks: An Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band muſt ſpeak little and modeſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:46351:11"/>of his Wife; a Mother would little divert, ſhould ſhe give an account of the cryings of her Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, and the care which the Nur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes take of them; we muſt be no leſs retentive in citing the ſaults of our Servants. What matter is it to the Company, if we have a lame Footman, or a ſlovenly Cook, or a Steward that makes us pay dear for that which he buys cheap? We ſhould always obſerve what diverts, and what tires; and that it is eaſier to avoid a fault, than to acquire a perfection: Examine we preſently what may render a man troubleſom, and we ſhall ſoon perceive how to make a Spirit of gayety and politeneſs reign in Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation. You have ſeen an a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeable repreſentation of theſe importunate people in the Come<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy of the <hi>Troubleſoms,</hi> and I doubt not but you have read the Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſations of a perſon who is general<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly eſteemed.</p>

I cannot en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure that Man who pretends that his Prince ſhould recompence him with a Veſſel which he has loſt. He tells you, without any mans offer to ask him, the Reaſons where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on his pretentions are grounded, and what may be alledged againſt them, and the replies he can make thereto. He at length names thoſe who built his Ship, and deſcribes all the parts of a Veſſel, to ſhew that his was very fine and coſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly.</p>

                  <p>I grant you that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing is more troubleſom than theſe doleful Relations; but when a man is about making them, you will not, I ſuppoſe, adviſe him to ſpeak facetiouſly of them. Not
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:46351:12"/>that I think it always neceſſary to accommodate ones Words and Countenance to the Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter treated of. On the contrary, a man cannot more eaſily raiſe a fit of laughter, than in relating ſome pleaſant paſſage with a cold and ſerious air. There is likewiſe a certain turn of Language which requires one to ſpeak highly big of mean things, and to give a plain and ſimple relation of great and noble Subjects. You may ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily perceive the Reaſon, for theſe latter bear up themſelves, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers have need of props. I ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe this is enough for this bout, having given you theſe general Advices, whereunto I may add, that in all ſorts of Entertainments, you muſt be ſure to avoid what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever may ſavour of For mality and Affectation.</p>

                  <p>I proteſt, Sir, you have already given me ſuch a clearneſs of underſtanding, that if you con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:46351:13"/>to inſtruct me, perhaps you will perceive ſuch ſucceſs, as will hinder you from repenting it.</p>

                  <p>I can aſſure you my counſels will be of little uſe to you, unleſs you mix therewith the frequenting of Company, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king cloſe and conſtant Obſervati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons thereupon. The Maxims of the greateſt Maſters are not of themſelves able to make a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleat Gentleman: A man becomes not a Painter, but by uſing the Pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil, how great a Judge ſoever he may be of good Pieces; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I will not give you any Max<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ims for the world, unleſs you in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to ſee it. Theſe inſtructions will be fruitleſs to a Solitary; he can never acquire the facility of uſing them. The beſt Precepts and choiceſt Morals will never take from him the perplext countenance which he brings from his Deſart. They can never take off that dull and melancholly air of his Cell.
<pb facs="tcp:46351:13"/>But on the contrary, we may ſay that advice gives great Aſſiſtance to perſons that take care to practiſe it. An hours reading is more pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable to theſe, than a whole year can be to contemplative perſons who keep always in their Studies. A man muſt practice immediately as ſoon as he is furniſh'd with good Rules; and it is uſeful for a man e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver and anon to examine theſe Precepts, when he enters into Company. This Precaution makes known the faults wherein one may fall; and there are ſome of ſuch a nature, as to make a man ridiculous for his whole life time, the firſt time he commits them. So that a man cannot be too much cauti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned againſt them.</p>

<pb n="17" facs="tcp:46351:14"/>them to ours. We will go to morrow morning, if you think fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, to find out what is moſt mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſh and proper for a perſon of your years and condition. You know we muſt not neglect the outſide.

That which does farther contribute to theſe favourable diſpoſitions, is a certain manner of behaviour and ſpeech that is ſoft and poliſht, which gives the name of civil to thoſe who commonly uſe them.</p>
                  <p>You know what are the Quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities which that which we call Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vility requires; and you have ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved without doubt, That that of our French, and the Urbanity of the Ancient Romans, draw their original from two words which

                  <p>If you pleaſe, Sir, tell me in what manner one may pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice this civility, and wherein it conſiſts?</p>

                  <p>The moſt important Rule which I would give in this matter, were I fit to be conſulted, ſhould be, that a man who would gain on affections, ſhould carry tokens of modeſty in his counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance and behaviour. He cannot draw envy, unleſs he appears poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſs'd in a good opinion of himſelf; and on the contrary, he cannot but be pleaſing to Company, if, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of appearing fierce and po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitive, he gives them marks of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteem and ſubmiſſion.</p>
                  <p>I would have one alſo to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve exactly a decent behaviour,
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:46351:15"/>according to the Sex, Age, and Quality of the perſon you converſe with, with regard likewiſe both to time and place. In effect, a Lady would be but little charm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, ſhould ſhe appear with the bluſtering meen of a Souldier; nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther would a Captain look well, if he affected to ſpeak ſoft and ſine, like a Sir <hi>Courtly Nice;</hi> and an old man would be ridiculous, ſhould he look on his toes, and ever and anon throw back the locks of his Peruke, like a young <hi>Beau</hi> of eigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen. Now to come to another kind of men; wou'd you ſpeak to a great Prelate, or to a grave Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrate, with as mimic an air as to a Chamber-fellow in the Acade<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my? We muſt allow that Decen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy requires that we not only be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>have our ſelves reſpectfully with perſons of a diſtinct Rank, but e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven not ſo much as to ſpeak of them in any manner which ſavours of equality. I do not believe that
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:46351:16"/>a perſon who has been of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue of an Ambaſſador in his Travels, will be ſo ridiculous as to ſay in his ordinary diſcourſe, <hi>When my Lord the Duke</hi> d'Eſtreé <hi>and I went to</hi> Rome <hi>together;</hi> Yet there are People, who ſpeaking to a great Lord, obſerve ſo little di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance as to ſay; <hi>You remember, Sir, what befell us when we ſet out for</hi> Ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; whereas they ſhould have men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned only the Lord's name, and barely have ſaid, <hi>When my Lord Duke</hi> d'Eſtreé <hi>went to</hi> Rome; and at to the ſecond expreſſion, <hi>When your Lordſhip parted.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I do not tell you that there are an infinite number of other Rules to be followed by a man that would appear like a Gentleman. You know that we muſt not only give the right hand and the wall to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons of Quality, but likewiſe yield them generally whatever ſeems moſt commodious. Your own Reaſon will ſhew you what is fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:46351:16"/>in theſe matters, without my advice. However it is good to uſe moſt of theſe little Maxims with an addreſs ſo much the greater in that it muſt not be perceived.</p>
                  <p>All muſt appear natural in a Gentleman, and no<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>hing muſt ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour of Art and Affectation.</p>
                  <p>I might moreover inſert ſome one of theſe precepts in our Enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainments: Should I collect them all at preſent, you would be perhaps diſguſted at them. Let us firſt conſider thoſe which are to be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved in entring into Company. When you go to ſee a perſon of a Rank above yours, you know, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out doubt, that it is to uſe too much familiarity, to enter with your Coach or Chair into the Court of his houſe. Civility requires we come out of them to enter on foot, unleſs the Porter, by his Maſter's order, opens the great Gate, and entreats you to enter more commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diouſly. If you be not known,
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:46351:17"/>and your name be ask'd, you are only barely to mention it, without adding thereto your Title of Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſs, or Sir <hi>John.</hi> You likewiſe are not to be taught, that when we find the Chamber door faſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, it's not civil to knock loudly with your ſtick, but rather ſoftly with your knuckles, or ſcratching the door. This faſhion came from the doors of the <hi>Louvre,</hi> and is now gotten to thoſe of the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters and Grandees of the Court, and I doubt not but it will get by degrees to all houſes where there is any Quality. But when a man firſt preſents himſelf, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly he whoſe office is to intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce perſons, takes care of level<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing theſe little difficulties.</p>

                  <p>I am of the ſame opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on as you: We have extended in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs of time the ſignification of this term. It has been thought fit to apply it to the Reverences which men make to one another, in bow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing down; in uncovering the head; and by accompanying theſe acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons with an 100 other grimaces, the more to teſtifie our ſubmiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. This Cuſtom is but the ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow of what it was, and it is well for us it is ſo.</p>
                  <p>However it is not ſo much a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſed, but that it endeavours to raiſe up its head. But thoſe per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons as know the world, retrench all theſe ſuperfluities, and obſerve only what decency requires. Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:46351:20"/>they fall not into fruitleſs exceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes of words, and ſubmiſſions, which are ſeldom taken for ſincere. And therefore they be commonly uſed to flatter in appearance, ſuch per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons as we do in effect deſpiſe.</p>
                  <p>To proceed farther; all theſe Ceremonies, and theſe Proteſtati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of Amity, would not only be look'd upon as ſo many diſſimula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, but one might look upon them as Crimes and Treacheries; if thoſe terms, which are at every turn uſed, had not loſt their firſt validity through long cuſtom. But we are wont no longer to take theſe words in a ſtrict ſenſe. We ſee every day people embrace one another, kiſs, and make a thouſand offers, as if they were the beſt Friends in the world; and who, a moment afterwards ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge, without heſitation, that they ſcarce knew one another. However we muſt follow this Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtom, inſtead of attempting to
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:46351:21"/>change it. It is leſs our fault than the fault of our age; and all that wiſe people can do, is, to uſe it with moderation and diſeretion. When all the world falls into a fault, no body can be blamed; and how extravagant ſoever a mode may be, a man would yet be ſtill more extravagent, if he refuſed to comply with it. Should he a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone offer to withſtand the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral conſent of his Country. Let us grant therefore, that there are Ceremonies of duty from which we cannot fairly excuſe our ſelves, but offend perſons who will ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine we pay 'em not their dues. So that the authority of Cuſtom may do all things in point of Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remony; and therefore it muſt be regarded as a kind of Law. Let not a man examine whether this Law be good or bad, it is ſufficient it has obtain'd, whereby we are obliged to obey it; and therefore it's neceſſary to know after what
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:46351:21"/>manner we ſhould carry our ſelves, and what terms we ſhould uſe in receiving viſits, how to return them, and to ſalute according to the Cuſtom of the Country. Great is the variety of expreſſion in theſe rencounters: Among us Civility requires we ſhould uſe the plural in ſpeaking to a ſingle perſon; per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps to ſignifie to him, that we eſteem him as much as many o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers.</p>
                  <p>Addreſſing our ſelves to a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of ordinary rank, yet we ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coſt him with, <hi>I pray you,</hi> Sir; whereas the ancient Romans ſaid, <hi>I pray thee.</hi> Which way of ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing is ſtill amongſt ſome Nations. The <hi>Turks,</hi> who are ſo ſubmiſſive to their Soveraigns, whoſe mean Slaves they term themſelves, yet uſe theſe kind of expreſſions when they ſpeak to him, <hi>If thy Highneſs commands it, &amp;c.</hi> And heretofore in <hi>Spain, Amirante</hi> uſed the word <hi>thou</hi> in ſpeaking to the King of <hi>Arra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gon;</hi>
                     <pb n="32" facs="tcp:46351:22"/>and we ſee that the Subjects of moſt Princes, ſpeak in a quite different manner; <hi>Amirante</hi> fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed the Cuſtom of his Country, and we ought to obey the Cuſtom of ours.</p>

                  <p>I have obſerv'd in a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation of the Court of <hi>Spain,</hi> that there is ſtill practis'd a thing very ſtrange, which is, That a Lover who finds his Miſtreſs in the Queen's prefence, may entertain her with the ſame liberty which he might elſewhere. Nay, he takes that of being covered, without of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence; his paſſion excuſes all; it muſt be ſuppoſed to be too violent to permit him to think of good manners. The more faults it makes him commit, the more it appears obliging to the perſon he loves.</p>

                  <p>I know not whether you have obſerv'd in the ſame Book one thing which is no leſs ſurpri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing. Which is, That the young
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:46351:22"/>Gentleman who make love to the Queen's Maids, ſend them openly diſhes of meat, and without any ſcruple, at every meal. But we ſhall go too far, ſhould we examine the difference there is betweenourman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of carriage and thoſe of other Nations. Let it content us in ſaying that among us we muſt ſalute per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, accoſt them, or receive them in the manner in uſe. A French man who would ſcruple to ſay, <hi>I am your moſt humble Servant,</hi> becauſe he felt in his Soul that there was no ſuch thing, would paſs for a ridiculous <hi>Miſanthropes.</hi> Men do not take theſe words ſtrictly; and we commonly uſe them without thinking on what they ſignifie; and whatever harſhneſs there is in them, it is ſoftned by long Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtom. The exacteſt probity per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits us to uſe them, and when a man asks me how I do, I may anſwer, <hi>That I am in good health, and ready to do him ſervice;</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:46351:23"/>being obliged to attend him at that very moment; and fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low him to his houſe like his Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant.</p>
                  <p>That which Reaſon enjoyns us in theſe occaſions, is, to uſe diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions in the Civilities which de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cency obliges us to pay. We muſt have regard to the age and the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of perſons, and the ſtate wherein they are; and if we find them ſick or buſie, the more ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonies we uſe, the more incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modious we make our ſelves. We muſt cut ſhort, and ſhew our ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timents, rather by ſome reſpectful Action, than by tedious Compli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. This proceeding ſhews that we know the world, and he that ſhall do otherwiſe, will paſs for an imprudent perſon.

                  <speaker>Dorante.</speaker>
                  <p>You may have obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved in the ſame Book, that if Pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence requires we ſhould omit words which are no longer in uſe; ſhe forbids us likewiſe to hunt after terms which the Ear is not accuſtomed to. We muſt leave theſe Novelties to young Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, ſeeing they affect them, and that Boldneſs is natural to them.</p>

                  <speaker>Liſidor.</speaker>
                  <p>But muſt not a Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage, that loſes words on one hand, not only recover them on the other, but alſo enrich it ſelf?</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Dorante.</speaker>
                  <p>I grant it; but it is not every bodies Province to enrich it; it belongs to learned and refined Perſons to bring in
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:46351:28"/>new words; as it belongs to Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons of the Court, that are well made, Richeſt, and of the beſt Fancies, to invent Faſhions for Cloaths.</p>
                  <p>However it is not enough to have choſen words which uſe approves. We muſt prefer thoſe which are propereſt to give the Idea of things which we would expreſs; we ought alſo to ſeek with care words which pleaſe the Ear, and which have Sweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, or Magnificence, according as the Matters require. As for Quibbles, Puns, and fulſom Jokes, we ſhould leave them to the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon People, as being ſuitable on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to men of their Rank.</p>

                  <p>I would willingly know why figurative Expreſſions are more graceful than others, and how they make up the Ornament of a Diſcourſe?</p>

                  <speaker>Dorante.</speaker>
                  <p>We may ſay they af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect more, becauſe we are leſs ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſtomed
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:46351:28"/>to them, but eſpecially becauſe they attribute more to things whereto they are joyned, than do the Proper and Natural Terms. They even enliven that which is inanimate. I could cite an infinite number of Examples: You hear Men ſay every day; <hi>What a ſad Place is this old Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle; How I love this Meadow! How every thing ſmiles there!</hi>

                  <p>For my part, I am for an Irony, and an Hyperbole; theſe are my two Favourites; and I have an hundred times obſerv'd the Converſation would be aſleep, did not theſe two Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gures ever anon keep it waking. Had <hi>Dorante</hi> ever ſo little wit, or learning, he would do me the greateſt pleaſure in the World in diſcourſing of them.</p>

               <sp>
                  <speaker>Liſider.</speaker>
                  <p>Methinks you cannot more pleaſingly begin this diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe, but by this Example of an Irony.</p>

                  <speaker>Dorante.</speaker>
                  <p>Do not you ſee that <hi>Eraſtus</hi> imagines he can diſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage himſelf, by thus ſmoothing me up; but he is miſtaken, for I ſhall not quit him thus. He muſt entertain us on this Subject. I am ſure he is a perfect Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter of it, ſeeing theſe two Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gures are ſo dear to him; and that he is a man not apt to fall in love where he is not well ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Eraſtus.</speaker>
                  <p>As to an Irony I am willing to ſay all I can on that Subject, but I'le warrant you I ſhall take heed of ſpeaking of the Hyperbole; for there port is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the Wits, that you marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed her, when ſhe was in mourn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for Mounſieur <hi>de Balſac</hi> her firſt Husband. So that it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs to you to inform us of her good Qualities: For I will not believe my Friend's Wife has any bad ones.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Dorante.</speaker>
                  <p>I confeſs, that to do
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:46351:29"/>me honour, two or three of my Friends have ſaid that I had a ſtrict Union with the Widow of this Illuſtrious deceaſed; but you may have obſerved, that if my Converſation ſhews ſhe pleaſes me; I appear'd leſs affected in what I wrote. However ſeeing you are pleaſed that I ſhould en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertain you about her, I will do it, and inſtead of reſpecting her as my Wife, I ſhall only conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der her as a Figure, to the end you may love her without any ſcruple.</p>
                  <p>An Hyperbole has commonly only exceſſive expreſſions, ſhe augments or diſtinguiſhes things in exceſs; but if it be permitted her to go beyond the bounds of Truth, yet ſhe muſt never paſs thoſe of reſemblance to truth. You know how I have treated of this elſewhere; and <hi>Liſider,</hi> not having ſeen the paſſage I ſpeak of, I need only repeat what
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:46351:30"/>the Idea which I ſtill retain will furniſh me with. I cannot forget a bold ſtroke I gave, which perhaps will never be par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned me.</p>
                  <p>I ſaid that <hi>Virgil</hi> went too far, when he ſet forth the light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of <hi>Camilla;</hi> and that I knew not whether in ſo great a Poem, one might make a Princeſs run over the tops of Corn without bending them, and over the waves of the Sea, without wetting the ſoles of her Feet. Theſe are in truth gliſtering expreſſions, but I think 'em not ſo well placed in a ſerious ſtile, as they would be in a light Poem.</p>
                  <p>There are alſo Authors, who think they carry not their Exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geration far enough, if they do not heap Hyperbole upon Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perbole. Now although there are infinite Hyperbolies in the Writings of witty men, who are pleaſed to ſport ingeniouſly with
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:46351:30"/>them, yet we muſt not think this Figure ought to be only uſed in raillery, and that it cannot well be ſeen in the moſt ſerious mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters. One of our Authors praiſing Cardinal <hi>Richlieu,</hi> addreſſes himſelf to him in theſe Terms, in an Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtile Dedicatory.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>But my Lord, as there was here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tofore a Valiant Man who could not receive any wounds, but on the ſcars of thoſe he had already received, ſo you cannot be praiſed, but by Repeti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions; ſeeing that truth, which hath its bounds, has ſaid for you, whatever falſhood, which knows none, has invent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for others.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I may add, that Hyperboles make a great impreſſion in a Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gical Subject. <hi>This Monſter having not ſufficiently glutted his Cruelty; and being not ſatisfied with the Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers of Blood, which he made run down this deſolate City, put all to Fire and Sword before him. He foam'd with Rage, and his Eyes more
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:46351:31"/>ardent and diſmal than two Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mets,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>But before we end, methinks we ſhould not forget <hi>Voiture,</hi> who is ſo full of agreeable Hyperboles. Have you not obſerved, <hi>How ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Towns he diſcovers,</hi> which are in no Maps? <hi>How many Mountains, which</hi> Geographers <hi>know nothing of? How many Terra's incognita's; and how many Rivers, and Seas, which the World never before heard of.</hi> He ingenuouſly confeſſes in another Letter, that he makes uſe of the Figure we ſpeak of: He makes the deſcription of a Feaſt, and ſays, if I be not miſtaken, <hi>That the Skie appeared on Fire, that all the places round about ſhined like Stars, and that it ſeemed as if the whole <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſe was turning in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a flame. He afterwards coldly adds, that theſe are</hi> 3 <hi>Hyperboles, which reduced to their juſt value, are juſt worth nothing.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I know not, <hi>Eraſtus,</hi> whether
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:46351:31"/>what I now ſaid ſatisfies you: You, I ſay, to whom the Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perbole was ſo familiar before you had eſpouſed <hi>Cleonice.</hi> Perhaps you have not as yet forgot how you ſet this Figure at work, when you came to find me, to impart to me your Joy, or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late to me your Grieſs. It is not above ſix Months ſince, <hi>That one minute without ſeeing</hi> Cleonice, <hi>was an Age of Trouble to you; and I am certain, that if you could entertain her an Age, you would look on this Age but as a Moment.</hi>
                  </p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Eraſtus.</speaker>
                  <p>I confeſs in thoſe days I made more often uſe of the Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perbole, than the Irony; but ſeeing I find my ſelf at preſent in a calmer condition, I ſhould be more diſpoſed to Gaiety than the Figure requires, which you would have me ſpeak of. You know better than I, what a great reliſh ſhe yields to Raillery, and I believe that <hi>Liſider</hi> is not to
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:46351:32"/>be taught that an Irony conſiſts in learning neatly to be underſtood, the contrary of what we ſay. I ſaw yeſterday at a Lady of Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity's a Marqueſs who this day was to ſet out for his Province, where he goes to confine himſelf. He came to <hi>Paris</hi> on occaſion of a Law-ſuit, and I believe he returns leſs out of humour for having parted with a great deal of mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney to Solicitors, and Lawyers, than to have remain'd three or four Months from his Seat and his Farms. He took a great de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light in recounting how he bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſied himſelf in the Country; and being my near Kinſman, I could no more ſuffer what he ſaid, than his manner of living. A Lady of the Company took notice of the Pain I was in, and repreſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to the Marqueſs. That in <hi>France</hi> a Perſon of Quality thought it more becoming him to ſerve in the Wars, than to amuſe him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:46351:32"/>in feeding Ducks and Pigeons. Our Country Gentleman ſmiled, and ſhewed by his anſwer. That he pitied thoſe Perſons that ſerv'd in the Wars. I could not then forbear ſpeaking, and directing my diſcourſe to this Lady, My Lord has reaſon (ſaid I to her a little roughly) and I aſſure you that the <hi>Corde's,</hi> the <hi>Turenn's,</hi> and the <hi>Crequi's,</hi> are to be blamed for not following his Example. Their lives would have been Glorious far from Armies; whereas they determined to ſpend them in beat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their Enemies, gaining Bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tels, and taking Cities. I know not what they thought in embra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing a profeſſion which ſo great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly leſſens their Memory. It's true they had the miſhap of not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſulting a Wit ſo ſolid as that of my Lord the Marqueſs. I utter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed theſe words with a ſerious Air, the Company ſmiled, and my Kinſman loſt his Countenance, and
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:46351:33"/>could not get it again all the Din<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner time.</p>
                  <p>I do not doubt but <hi>Liſidor</hi> knows, That we comprehend the ſenſe of an Irony, either by a tone of Pronunciation which diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers that we are not in earneſt, or by the apparent oppoſition there is between the words and the thing ſpoken of. It was by this laſt means that I was under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood; for they ſaw nothing but what was ſerious in my Diſcourſe and on my Countenance. But ſeeing that you have cited Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors, methinks it is lawful for me to ſay, That an Irony gliſters throughout all the Works of <hi>Voi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture</hi> and <hi>Saraſin.</hi> You are not ſurpriſed at this, but I am, in ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in <hi>Malherbe</hi>'s Letters a Rail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lery ingeniouſly turn'd, which I may take for a kind of rony. I was ſo content with ſeveral paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſages of this famous Author's Rhime, that I dared not read
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:46351:33"/>his Proſe, ſo greatly was I afraid of loſing the Eſteem I would preſerve for him. <hi>Liſidor</hi> will not be diſpleaſed in hearing how in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geniouſly <hi>Malherbe</hi> relates the News of the Siege of <hi>Veruë.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>The</hi> Spaniards <hi>are always be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore</hi> Veruë, <hi>it's a place that is a little more worth than</hi> Chaliot; <hi>but is far from being ſo good as</hi> Lagny. <hi>However the Duke</hi> de Feria <hi>lies ſtarving there with cold, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding the Dog-days. The Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhal</hi> de Crequi <hi>has lodg'd himſelf between the Beſieged and the Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiegers, and does wonders, according as he is wont. If you ask me what I expect, I believe that the</hi> Spani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ards <hi>will ſee the Steeples and Chim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neys of this Town; but as for the Streets of it, they muſt get their notices of them in the Map. I would adviſe them, if they pretend ſtill to the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſal Monarchy, either that they would proceed more quick in their work, or beg of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:46351:34"/>to put a ſtop to the end of the World, that they may have time e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough to finiſh it,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>I ſhall not expatiate any longer on this matter; I find it large, and I like it; I am afraid leſt it ſhould carry me too far.</p>

                  <p>You ought not to have the ſame fear of the <hi>Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theſis.</hi> I have ever heard you ſay, That you could not endure it. However, the oppoſition of words and thoughts, may give great luſtre to a diſcourſe. But I am of your mind, that he that uſes this Figure, muſt be an Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my to all Affectation, and not ſo much conſult the ſporting with Words, as the uttering good Senſe.</p>

                  <p>Let us leave here theſe Matters; for they require too great Application, and I am for diverting the Converſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>

                  <p>I demand Quarter for
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:46351:34"/>the deſcription. It is agreeable, it renders the Aſſembly attentive, and I ſee nothing more neceſſary than to know how to paint well the things we would repreſent. We may find our ſelves every mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment oblig'd to make uſe of this Figure; ſometimes in deſcribing a pleaſant Proſpect, a fine Houſe; otherwhiles a Ship wrack or a Battel. Eſpecially if I came from ſeeing a Stranger of great Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, or a beautiful Princeſs lately arriv'd, and I were ask'd what I thought of one, and the other, ſhould not I be glad to make a Portraicture of them ſo like, as might place before their eyes the Perſons I would ſpeak of.</p>

                  <speaker>Eraſtus.</speaker>
                  <p>What you ſay makes without doubt the principal Beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of what one relates; but here is in what Terms <hi>Dorante</hi> has explained himſelf in one of his Books touching Portraictures, which every one undertakes to draw
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:46351:35"/>after his Fancy. <hi>There are a great many People who ſet forth their Friends; There are others who ſet forth themſelves, and who ratail out their Defects and their Virtues, without concerning themſelves at what the publick will judge of them. In fine, every body takes the Pencil in hand; but I know not whether there be many</hi> Apelles<hi>'s among this great number of Painters. Yet it is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, that a Mediocrity is not excu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſable in theſe ſort of works, for la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring therein leſs through neceſſity, than for Ornament, every thing ſhould gliſter therein, and nothing ſhould appear languiſhing.</hi> One may de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribe or make a Recital in two different manners; The firſt Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural, Simple, and Succinct; The o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther more Extenſive and Flouriſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. If the diſpute be touching the waters of a River, as to the right which may be pretended for the watering of Meadows, or turning of Mills; a man need only relate
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:46351:35"/>preciſely the circumſtances, which may ſerve to give light into the diſpute. But if I ſpeak not of this River, but to deſcribe a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licate place, I may then expati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate, and ſay, <hi>That it's Cryſtal wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters wind themſelves about a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightful Valley, either to water it in the more places, or to ſhew that they are pleaſed with it, and leave it with regret.</hi> It is in theſe oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſions that Poetry may triumph, provided ſhe uſes, with a lively Fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, and a ſolid Judgment, the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledge ſhe has of ſhewing her ſelf bolder, and leſs reſerv'd than in Proſe. And therefore, in this laſt manner of making a deſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, or a recital, I ſhould forget none of the Circumſtances which may give any reliſh to what I un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertook to recount. If it were an Hiſtory, or ſome adventure of thoſe great Fables which have diverted our Nation, under the name of Romance, I would en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:46351:36"/>to point my Hero's in a moſt exact manner. Thoſe who were to hear me repreſenting them, ſhould make, if I may ſo ſay, ſuch a kind of acquaintance with them, as would engage them to hearken to me, and induce them at the ſame time to take part in whatever regards the Perſons I ſhould entertain them with.</p>

                  <speaker>Liſidor.</speaker>
                  <p>I aſſure you, that in reading the works of <hi>Calprénéde,</hi> I have always intereſs'd my ſelf in whatever hapned to his He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ro's and Ladies; and when I ſaw in <hi>Faramond</hi> all thoſe Kings.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Dorante.</speaker>
                  <p>Perhaps you ſaw too many of them. The Author, you ſpeak of, has gathered together as many on the banks of the Rhine, as the Marqueſs <hi>d'<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rfé</hi> did Shepherds on the banks of <hi>Lignon:</hi> However you may eaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly judge there are ſomething few<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er Kings than Shepherds, yet we may juſtifie <hi>Calprénéde</hi> in ſome
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:46351:36"/>ſort. The Romances he ſet forth were like Epic Poems in Proſe. They had more of the <hi>Illiad</hi> and <hi>Aenead</hi> than the <hi>Theagenes</hi> and <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrea.</hi> Moreover the Age of <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ramond</hi> permitted him to menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on thoſe great number of Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raigns. It was after the death of the great <hi>Theodoſius;</hi> and as his Children ſucceeded not in his Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour, and that they weakned the Empire in ſharing it, ſo an infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite number of Barbarons Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons took that time to ſettle them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves in better Countries than their own. Theſe Nations march'd under Leaders who were Kings, or to whom one might give this Title, which <hi>Homer</hi> has ſo pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digally beſtowed on ſo many Greeks. As for the Characters, I confeſs they are a little too u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niform in the writings of <hi>Calpré<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>néde.</hi> We find none therein but brave and fierce Blades; whereas there ſhould be variety, to give
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:46351:37"/>relliſh to a Recital, and to render it more probable.</p>

                  <speaker>Eraſtus.</speaker>
                  <p>I believe likewiſe we are oblig'd to obſerve a greater reſemblance to truth in what we invent, than in the true Facts which we mix with ſome adven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture: for we commonly believe what is true; and when it ſhould not be believ'd, by reaſon of it's little reſemblance, we ſhall not be Vouchers, as in things which come from us.</p>
               </sp>

                  <speaker>Dorante.</speaker>
                  <p>It ſeems to me, that to make things probable; beſides the truths which we ought dex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trouſly to inſert, it is good to ſet forth Perſons ſuch as they ſhould be, to execute what we make them undertake. As for a bold Action, we ſhould deſcribe a ſtrong man, brought up in the Wars, of an aſſured Countenance, and a grim Aſpect. But if I may again ſpeak of the Expreſſions which we ſhould uſe, I would
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:46351:37"/>ſay they muſt be Natural, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Flatneſs, a kind of Nobleneſs and Elevation in them; according as the matters require, but no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing flatulent or forc'd. A man ſhould baniſh Equivocal Terms and Tranſpoſitions, and uſe only Parentheſes through Neceſſity and with Judgment; and retrench all thoſe Circumſtances which ſerve neither to inſtruct nor delight.</p>

                  <p>Speaking freely, as we do in theſe matters, we may add ſomething as to the choice of words. It is not enough to uſe thoſe which are propereſt to give the Idea of what we would re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſent, we muſt alſo know the Terms which belong to Arts, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther our Recital relates to matters concerning Painting or Sculpture, War or Navigation.</p>
                  <p>This Remark brings to my re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance a brisk Anſwer which an Officer of our Fleet made to a young Gentleman of this Town, who
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:46351:38"/>made one Campaign on his Veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel. The <hi>Pariſian</hi> walking one night on the Bridge to take the Air, Pray, Sir, ſays he, let's be gone, the wind is very high <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Sir, ſays the Officer, know that for a Sea-man to ſay, The wind is very high, is a very great ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurdity, ſeeing the term is; It is foul, or hard weather.</p>
                  <p>Although we muſt uſe terms proper to Arts, yet it is not ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to be ſo ſcrupulous as a Phyſician of my acquaintance was the other day. Having called to him a Chirurgion who was in the Sick man's Chamber: You muſt not fail, ſays he, to Phleboto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe the Gentleman to morrow morning. I will never ſuffer it, (cried out the Sick man in a fright) and I am not, continued he, in ſo bad a condition to have recourſe to ſo dreadful an opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. The Chirurgion replying immediately thereupon (that he
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:46351:38"/>might not loſe his little profit,) Sir, ſaid he to the ſick Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, be not troubled, the Doctor only orders a bleeding. Ah for bleeding, replied he, I matter it little, but for the reſt, I will as ſoon dye as endure it.</p>

                  <p>Do you think it e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough to have ſpoken of words which ſignifie preciſely what we have to ſay, or which are proper to Arts? Is it not alſo fitting to find Terms which may neatly en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cloſe the things which we would have underſtood, and which mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſty will not permit us to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs openly? Should I not do better in ſaying, There is a ſecret Correſpondence between the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſs of — and the Counteſs of — than to explain my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf too groſly on the manner of their Commerce?

                  <p>I find likewiſe that there are expreſſions which Gentlemen ſhould uſe when there happens ſome con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt between them. If any one ſhould make me repeat ſome cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtance of a Recital, and he ſhould tell me he did not hear me.

So that inſtead of complaining againſt one, that has not perform'd his promiſe, I ſhould chuſe to ſay; <hi>That I hoped he would do it; but that I

He does it delicately; whereas people, that know not the world, give praiſes with ſo little addreſs, and with ſo great exceſs, that they perplex and put to the bluſh thoſe they think to oblige. Whereunto we may add, That a man who excels in his profeſſion, muſt not preſently ſpeak of it; and when he does, it muſt be with great modeſty, and when the Converſation turns on that hinge.</p>

We cannot be excuſed from going to morrow to <hi>Eraſtus;</hi> but although I uſe freedom with him, yet we will diſcourſe to night of certain poliſh'd and reſpectful manners with which it is fit to appear before Ladies. You know, without doubt, that nothing makes a young Gentleman ſo much va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lued, as the approbation of a La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy of merit; and that nothing more hinders Perſons of your Age from falling into irregularities, than the viſiting Perſons whoſe ſenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:46351:42"/>incline ordinarily to Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue. In the mean time, ſpeak we of the precautions it is neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry you be furniſh'd with for this viſit; and let me begin by an ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice which perhaps you little ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect, which is on the manner of making an honour. You are per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded, without doubt, That your dancing Maſter has omitted no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing he ought to tell you here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon: and I am likewiſe willing to believe you ſalute with a bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter grace than he that taught you to ſalute. I know that moſt Maſters are too formal in theſe matters; They bow down, and raiſe themſelves up by rule only. Every thing is ſtarch'd in them, all ſavours of Art, and ſearcely have they ended their Reverence, but they ſeem to promiſe the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of a <hi>Courant</hi> or <hi>Minuet.</hi> Perſons of Quality on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, ſalute with a better Air, and in a more natural manner.
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:46351:43"/>If you feel ſtill any kind of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraint, you muſt get rid of it as ſoon as you can, and give to your countenance and action all requiſite liberty. Remember then, if you pleaſe, That we muſt al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways endeavour to do with a good grace what may draw the firſt reſpects of Perſons we ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſs our ſelves to. Nothing af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards renders us more agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able than Complaiſance: It is this which makes up the Charms of Society; without it we muſt nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther expect friendſhip among men, nor a diverting Converſation in Company, nor any part at play, or in a walk, or any other diver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion. But when I ſay we muſt be complaiſant, I do not mean, That baſe and ſervile Complai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſance which <hi>Juvenal</hi> attributes to certain Greeks of his time, who made their Court at <hi>Rome.</hi> It muſt be acknowledg'd, ſays he, that this Nation is very comical.
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:46351:43"/>Do you ſay it is hot, they wipe the Sweat off their Forehead. Do you complain it is cold; they call for their furr'd Gown. There are then ſeveral complaiſances which one muſt not have. It is not lawful to betray our ſenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments in eſſential things, nor to favour Vice in any occaſion what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever. One may ſhew the reſpect we have for great perſons and La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, but we muſt never ſhew them a Complaiſance which may be prejudicial to them. They will no ſooner perceive it, but they will hate and deſpiſe us.</p>

                  <p>I conceive that Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaiſance is good in a thouſand particulars, and that no Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation could be kept up long with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out it. However I know not whether Converſation would not dye, if Complaiſance reigned too abſolutely in a Company, and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very body will'd the ſame thing; whereas it becomes lively and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructive,
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:46351:44"/>as ſoon as an ingenious debate encourages us to maintain different opinions. So that I would willingly know in what bounds one may include a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendable Complaiſance, imagin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that it conſiſts in a Medrum, between two vitious extreams, like other Virtues.</p>

                  <p>We may without fear of being blam'd, prefer, through Complaiſance, one pleaſure to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother, as play before walking, and of Plays the choice of that which ſhall beſt pleaſe the perſon for whom we have a deference. However our Complaiſance muſt not turn to our notable preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice, nor be prejudicial to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons for whom we muſt not have ſo much Complaiſance, as to play at a play which a Perſon of great Quality may like, without any Skill in it, ſeeing our Complai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſance might be ſuſpected of Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt. It will be generous, if we
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:46351:44"/>know not ſo well the Game as the Perſon of Quality who enga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges us to play; however we muſt never expoſe our ſelves to the undergoing a loſs, which may in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commode us; for this laſt Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaiſance will be liable to be ridi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culed.</p>
                  <p>The beſt effect of Complaiſance is to make us endure the weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes of a Friend, and not to yield to anger when he is diſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered by it. Far from provoking him, by earneſtly withſtanding what he deſires, we ſhould im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately ſeem to yield to him, and oppoſe only ſentiments full of ſweetneſs to the violence of his paſſion. But there are ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Complaiſances which I can never approve of: We may ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve one, which may be called Univerſal, which makes men ſay, <hi>Yes,</hi> to all ſorts of things, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out diſtinction; and this appears to me to be ſuch a ſorry humour,
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:46351:45"/>That I ſhould like better to be ſharply conteſted with.</p>

                  <p>The Complaiſances you mention, may diſpleaſe; but they deceive no body; whereas thoſe of the Court ſerve com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly only to make one take ſalfe meaſures. A great Lord pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes all, and a quarter of an hour after, he does not ſo much as re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member that he made any pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe.

                  <p>The Complaiſance which one has for back-biters is yet more pernicious; for this is a ſacrificing thoſe who are abſent, and the upholding a vice which all generous Perſons deteſt. I find
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:46351:45"/>this Complaiſance ſo mean, ſo criminal, that I think it needleſs to ſay any thing more againſt it; being perſwaded you can never be capable of ſalling into it. Let us rather return to the Subject which has caſt us on this matter, and let us ſay, That the Complaiſance which we ought to have for La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies has bounds large enough. You know that men are weak, but with reſpect which we owe to women: we may ſay they are yet weaker, and more credulous than we. As they are ordinarily prepoſſeſt with a good opinion of themſelves, ſo they like thoſe who flatter this ſelf-love, and cannot bear with any body that ſhall diſabuſe them. A ſolid Friend who ſhould undertake to open their eyes, will ſoon be caſt off for a Friend; and I have ſound it more than once, That they put a ſincere Perſon on very vexa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious Tryals. Not that I would
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:46351:46"/>be ſo ſcrupulous to contradict them in matters of ſmall moment. On the contrary, I would give to the defects which they might have, the Names of the Virtues which come neareſt them: I would call Covetouſneſs, Fruga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity: I would commend in a lean Lady the liberty of her Shape: and I would endeavour to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend the ample Corpulency of Madam Bouv<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

To ſpeak all in two words, let's ſay in general, That to be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaiſant, it is good to conſult the countenance and humour of the Perſon whom we would pleaſe, and that we do in ſuch a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner conform our ſelves thereto, that ſhe may not doubt of the part we take in what concerns her.</p>

                  <p>To aſcend higher, and to come up to the Ancients; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides what the works you have cited do diſcover to us; we may conjecture that at the Table of great Perſons the Converſation made one part of the Regale. In effect, the <hi>Paraſites,</hi> for to be there ſuffer'd, were not content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in being complaiſant even to the meaneſt flatteries, but they ſtudied likewiſe to ſay ſomething witty, to divert thoſe who ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh'd the Feaſt.</p>

                  <p>I agree with you in what you ſay; but muſt tell you
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:46351:48"/>farther, that theſe <hi>Paraſites</hi> were more contemptible than diverting. Their profeſſion was to be plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant; and you know what we have already ſaid, That nothing can be pleaſing where there ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears affectation. But let us leave theſe Wretches, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn to the little advices which I am willing to give you.</p>
                  <p>Being to dine at a Friend's, I make no mention to you of certain Ceremonies touching waſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with Perſons of great Rank. He muſt be very ignorant of the world, who ſhall draw near to the Baſin at the ſame time a Prince or great man ſhall dine in the ſame company. You muſt ſtay till he entreats you to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance, or by taking you by the hand, or by ſome ſign denoting he intends you this honour. Then you are to ſhew, by a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpectful bowing of the body, that it is only out of obedience to his
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:46351:48"/>commands that you offer to waſh with him; but if in waſhing at <hi>Eraſtus</hi>'s, the Servants come not immediately to take the Towel, Civility requires you hold it till the Officer be preſent, or <hi>Eraſtus</hi> himſelf takes it out of your hands. It is his part not to ſuffer you in this poſture. You may ſtay till <hi>Cleonice</hi> places you; but I believe it will be more neat for you to place your ſelf at the low<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er end of the Table, to avoid Ceremonies. Have you never reflected on the different ways uſed in theſe occaſions?</p>

                  <p>I have obſerv'd it an hundred times in my life, though I am not very old. I have ſeen people caſt their eyes greedily on the meat, as it were to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour it before they came to it; and ſcarce were they ſat down, but they ſnatch'd up what they liked. They reach'd over their hands into the fartheſt diſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es,
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:46351:49"/>without minding whether they ought to ſtretch their arms over other meats, and before Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons to whom they ow'd reſpect. I have alſo obſerv'd, that in the beginning of the repaſt, there are ſome who bend themſelves over their Plates, as it were, to keep them in their ſight, or to eat there with their eyes, what they cannot hand up quick enough to their mouths. Theſe are a ſort of people who bow continually, who excite o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers to eat and drink, and who endeavour to change the mirth of a Feaſt into fury. They put all into diſorder; they imagine to bring greater honour to the treat, and the more trouble and confuſion they cauſe, the more they think the Maſter of the houſe is obliged to them. I have known others, who diſdain to make uſe of Spoons and Forks, as much as if they were not made for their uſe: Their knuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kles
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:46351:49"/>are indifferently in every diſh, and by this means they quickly make their Fingers and Napkins loathſom to the ſight of the Company.</p>

                  <p>Seeing you have made theſe little Obſervations, and that it is chiefly the things which regard an Entertainment that we have choſen to examine: I will tell you, That at Treats men com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly fall into two contrary faults, which are equally to be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voided; which is to praiſe with exceſs the diſhes before you, or to ſay nothing at all, but look coldly on the delicacies and abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of a Feaſt. By the firſt defect a man ſhews himſelf little accuſtomed to good Tables, or too greedy of the good chear; and by the other, he ſeems to deſpiſe whatever obligations the Maſter of the Feaſt intends to lay on him. Neither would I have a man to ſpeak with great earneſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:46351:50"/>of the meats he loves beſt, or thoſe which he cannot endure, there are certain affected reliſhes, which are only tolerable in women.</p>

                  <p>I imagine likewiſe that it is a great indiſcretion, not to appear content with the manner of ſeaſoning certain diſhes. One cannot find fault, without provo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king the Maſter of the houſe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt his Servants, and making him threaten the turning them away, and putting him all the time out of humour; and the whole Company into a mournful ſilence.</p>

                  <p>I am very glad you have made this remark, it will hinder you from appearing unea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie, and paſſionate againſt your people, whenever you make an Entertainment. I hope too you will not fall into a fault which I think an intollerable one in Gentlemen; which is to drink hard your ſelf, or make others do it. Do you judge whether
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:46351:50"/>theſe exceſſes are agreeable to the politeneſs we diſcourſe of, and whether a man whoſe reaſon is drowned in Wine, can have an agreeable Converſation? Is it not a ſhame to make it a point of Honour, to empty more Bottles than the reſt of the Company, without conſidering that in this ridiculous conteſt, the gallanteſt man of the Court, cannot exce<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

They expoſed their Slaves full of Wine to the ſight of their Children, and found nothing more likely to make this intemperance odious, than the ſidelong ſteps, the extravagancies, and nauſeous belches whereto Drunkenneſs ſubjects us. Let not any one tell me, that a man is willing to ſhew that he has a ſtrong head: It is in other ſort of occaſions we ſhould give Proof
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:46351:51"/>of that; and not weaken our heads when all that is required of us is only to be chearful, and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve moderation.

To prove this, I need only tell you what a Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grin I had at a viſit I receiv'd yeſterday; it was <hi>Arpalice</hi> that gave it me. She entred into my Chamber, with a languiſhing Air,

Muſt this prating Goſſip ſhew her Commode, and make the Company gueſs what it coſt, and where ſhe bought it? How hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py am I who have been never tempted to prejudice my health by much ſpeaking and to deafen the Aſſembly.

<pb n="99" facs="tcp:46351:55"/>who talk leſs. Should one forbid them to ſpeak of their Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coutrements; you reduce them to a profound ſilence.

Has ſhe not reaſon to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend on the contrary, that ſhe will paſs for a Fool, in gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving more for things than their value? Neither would I have you, Madam, to imagine that I am about to tell you my Gown ſtood me in leſs than it was worth; No, no, I pretend not to ſet up for a great houſewife, thereby to get an husband. I have one already that I would be loth to part with.

It is true, I give him no cauſe; I never bring home any of thoſe Gallants, or Vagabond Sparks, that walk from Street to Street, caſting up their Foppiſh Countenances at every Window, and now and then ſtep and ſtrut, like a Crow in a gut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, who never want fine ſayings for all Complexions.

<pb n="110" facs="tcp:46351:61"/>they have not opened their mouths, for fear of falling into the fault we now reprehended; I would fain therefore hear what <hi>Liſidor</hi> will ſay on this Subject.</p>

               <sp>
                  <speaker>Liſidor.</speaker>
                  <p>That in a Company as this is, he ought to hear much and ſpeak little.</p>

                  <p>I know not whether this anſwer be as wiſe as it ſeems to be: For young people muſt ſpeak to acquire the facility of ſpeaking; and they can no where better make cryal, than before their Friends, who will make it a matter of duty to correct them: But ſeeing I have ſpoken ſenten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiouſly, I muſt proceed and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terrogate <hi>Lindamire.</hi> How comes it, that being witty, young, and gay, you have ſaid nothing? were there but three Perſons of your humour in this Chamber, the diſcourſe would quickly be at an end.</p>

               <sp>

                  <p>I can aſſure you,

                  <p>Before we end it, I would declare the inſtruction which a certain Lady not far, has made me draw hence, which is, that to be never accuſed of ſpeaking much, one ſhould ſpeak as ſhe does; and one had need
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:46351:62"/>only to ſee her often, to accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtom one's ſelf to ſpeak little, through the pleaſure a body may have in hearkening to her.</p>

               <sp>
                  <speaker>Eraſtus.</speaker>
                  <p>It is your ſelf, Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam, who now ſpake too much, and you are now about being re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compenſed for your flattery. The Lady perhaps whom you would have us to underſtand, will be far from applying it to her ſelf; and to puniſh you again in another ſort, I believe ſhe will make you but very ill chear.</p>
                  <p>At theſe words the company aroſe, <hi>Dorante</hi> gave his hand to <hi>Beliſe, Philemon</hi> to <hi>Cleonice,</hi> and <hi>Liſidor</hi> his to the young <hi>Linda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mire.</hi> They withdrew into a little Parlor, where they waſht without Ceremony, and after the ſame manner ſat down at Table. Although this was only a treat for Friends, yet every thing was proper and neat: Scarce had they dined, when they returned into
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:46351:62"/>
                     <hi>Cleonice</hi>'s Chamber, where they ſat down, and talk'd only of indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent things, till <hi>Eraſtus</hi> began to ſpeak to enliven the Converſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>

                  <p>
                     <hi>Lindamire</hi> will perhaps be aſtoniſh'd if ſhe hears me ſpeak again without ſetting forth for <hi>America,</hi> where ſhe would a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain ſend me. So long a Voyage does not ſeem to me abſolutely ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary, for the reaſſuming of the diſcourſe we left off. I need only tell you, that among the defects of great talkers, we have not, I think, made any mention of Lying, which yet is the Vice wherewith ſuch perſons are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly repreached.</p>

However, it is not impoſſible to make the diſtinction you ſpeak of, provided a man has a pier<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing and diſcerning judgment. A man that would appear ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere, without being ſo in effect, does oftentimes diſcover himſelf, even by the care he takes to conceal himſelf. He forgets nothing to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain his ends, but it is not ſo hard as you imagine to perceive certain efforts he makes to perſwade. The earneſtneſs which he ſhews, and the turn which he gives to his expreſſions are obſervable. Frankneſs guides it ſelf in a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect contrary manner, it tends plainly where it would go: It has a more open Air, appears in the eyes, in the geſture, and all
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:46351:67"/>the countenance. In ſtead of having recourſe to Ornaments of Language, it rejects them as fruitleſs, it is an enemy of oſten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, and neglects the appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing wholly and fully what it is. It ſpeaks without Art, and with Confidence, and yet never fails of making a ſoft impreſſion.

And of this I have an inſtance in the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the laſt month, when the Court was at <hi>Fontain-Bleau.</hi> We were together in the Country, <hi>Timante</hi> and I, and we viſited in our journey honeſt <hi>Merigenes,</hi> to whoſe politeneſs and capacity I ſuppoſe you are no ſtranger. <hi>Cle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onice</hi> ſeemed ſhy of travelling with two men, and therefore took one of her Friends along with her, called <hi>Melicerte.</hi> I cannot tell whether you know her, but I can truly ſay, that if ſhe be not handſom, ſhe is young and wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. She was of ſo an agreeable humour the firſt night we ſupt at <hi>Merigenes</hi>'s, that the good man ſhew'd himſelf really ſmit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten with her, and addreſſing himſelf on a ſuddain to <hi>Timante,</hi> I wonder, ſaid he to him, you ſhould reckon <hi>Melicerte</hi> homely,
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:46351:68"/>I find you but a bad judge of Beauty, and I'le never truſt you in theſe matters again.</p>
                  <p>Conſider, I pray you, into what confuſion this ſimplicity caſt us. <hi>Timante</hi> did what he could to repair the fault he had committed in ſpeaking, without doubt, too freely to a perſon of <hi>Merigenes</hi>'s humour. Remember more punctually my words, an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered he, I told you that <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licerte</hi> was a very amiable per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, and yet the charms of her face were not wholly comparable to the excellency of her humour. Acknowledge, <hi>Timante,</hi> (replied <hi>Melicerte</hi> endeavouring to ſmile) That you are leſs ſincere now, than you was when you ſpake of me before, and yield that <hi>Merigenes</hi> is incomparably more than you. It is true, Madam, (replied imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately the honeſt man) you do me juſtice; I proteſt I always ſpeak what I think is the truth.
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:46351:69"/>I perceive it, ſaid ſhe with a cold Air, and being not able to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemble her reſentment.

But if any ſpark of Envy has induced her to pour venom in her relations, I could utter ſuch truths as would not be very advantageous to her. <hi>Dorilas,</hi> whoſe humour you know would not let paſs this occaſion
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:46351:74"/>of diverting us, and pretending to be in the intereſts of <hi>Dori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nice,</hi> whom he thought fit to edge on; I know not (ſaid he with a feigned ingenuity) whether <hi>Celanire</hi> has a good way of ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting off her Friends; howe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, I muſt ſay, ſhe has no good way of covering their defects. Why ſhould ſhe come with her circumſtances, the relations of which we never call'd for; what are we concern'd with her <hi>Timo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crates,</hi> that ſhe ſhould bring him into a relation, when the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe was only about a Gown or Petticoat. I would willingly know (replied <hi>Dorinice</hi> all in an heat) what ſhe could ſay of <hi>Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mocrates,</hi> and whether ſhe has had the malice to empoyſon—You are to blame in complain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing (ſaid <hi>Dorilas,</hi> interrupting her coldly) ſhe has only fairly related the opinions which the world has, when a man buys a
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:46351:74"/>rich piece of Stuff, which is af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards obſerv'd to be carried to a fair Lady; and after all, who can ſay, that <hi>Celanire</hi> will ſpeak of it any where elſe? What ſhe has ſaid here ſignifies nothing; here was not in this room above four or five men, and ſeven or eight women. We could not for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bear laughing at this pleaſant paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage, which <hi>Dorinice</hi> obſerving, ſhe appear'd moved with it, and was ready to fly upon <hi>Dorilas.</hi> However ſhe bethough her ſelf not to diſoblige any body, in a company which ſhe was glad to make ſavourable to her; and, diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembling her reſentment, ſhe diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered only her paſſion againſt <hi>Celanire.</hi> I cannot comprehend, ſaid ſhe, how this woman could have the imprudence to ſpeak againſt me.

I would adviſe her to have leſs preſumption, if it be only this which renders her ſo bold. I am no more a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraid of <hi>Timante</hi> than <hi>Celanire,</hi> and I have an hundred times told them both, that I was a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſham'd of their conduct. It's well known that <hi>Timante</hi> has not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove two hundred pound a year to live on, and yet keeps his fine Coach, and three Lacqueys.

It's not three months ſince ſhe gave money to a perſon of Quality who went into <hi>Flanders,</hi> and entreated him to buy her ſome of that Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries Horſes. The Commiſſion was executed, the Horſes came, but not into <hi>Celanire</hi>'s Stable. They draw every day <hi>Timante</hi> in his viſits to Court and other Walks. The Coach they draw is a very fine one, and the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter of it knows no more than I, what it coſt.

                  <p>As for the gifts of the body, all the world immediately declares it ſelf for the beauty of women, and the good Meen of men, and for my particular, I prefer health and a noble and free Air in all manner of behaviour.</p>
                  <p>We forget not the favours which we hold of Fortune. It is ſhe which gives Riches and Honours. And I dare even af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm ſhe often contributes to our Glory, in conducting us as it

                  <p>I confeſs I would have Equity reign every where. So that I would not condemn thoſe who reproach <hi>Caeſar</hi> for having oppreſt the Liberty of his Country; and who cannot
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:46351:83"/>bear with <hi>Alexander</hi>'s carrying Fire and Sword into Countries where they never ſo much as heard of him. Let's inſtance, for Example, a great Monarch who makes only lawful Conqueſts.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Here's what I read this Morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of it: Has he ever attack'd any place without winning it? Has he ever giv'n Battel without van<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſhing? Were ever better diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plin'd Troops ſeen, Troops more zealous, more ready to fight and ſignalize themſelves? What Conque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour, ſurrounded with warlike Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, has ſtretch'd the limits of his Conqueſts ſo far, in ſo ſhort a time? What Warriour has triumph'd over ſuch puiſſant Confedarates, and ever rendred his Dominions more redou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table and flouriſhing?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Here's what was ſaid here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tofore of an Illuſtrious Warri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our, whoſe Valour rais'd him to the Empire.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>He practiſes himſelf alone all
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:46351:84"/>the Military Virtues, and it is an admirable thing, that being above all Corrivals, he contends for glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry with himſelf; he endeavours to raviſh it from his firſt actions by others ſtill more glorious.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>As to what concerns Liberali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, I would have it no leſs ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>empt from Oſtentation than Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour. I would have it readily ſhew'd, in a grateful manner, and the moſt ſeemly as is poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, when it is to relieve perſons who want neceſſaries for their Subſiſtance. But I require, on the contrary, that one give in the ſight of as many people as is poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible, when the gift is the recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence of merit.</p>
                  <p>In a word I would have a libe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral perſon to do as one of my friends did, whoſe liberality is thus mention'd.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>His Liberality equals that of a magnificent Prince in the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of Preſents, and ſurpaſſes it in
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:46351:84"/>the choice of Perſons. Thoſe who receive his benefits, are the only Perſons that can ſpeak of 'em. In fine, his generoſity would be more u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niverſally admired, if it were not ſo great, becauſe more perſons would comprehend it, in an Age wherein this Virtue is ſo rarely practis'd in it's perfection.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Loving as I do extreamly this beneficent humour, you would have me ſpeak more of it, and enlarge my ſelf a little on the bounty of a great King.</p>
                  <p>One cannot ſpeak more advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tageouſly of a private perſon, than to ſay that he has the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of a Prince; and one cannot better praiſe a great Potentate, than in ſaying he has the good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of a private perſon: That in a condition which permits him every thing, he endeavours only to ſatisfie others. Was ever ſeen in a mean fortune ſo much goodneſs as he ſhews in the midſt
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:46351:85"/>of his greatneſs? Whilſt all <hi>Europe</hi> lies proſtrate at his feet, implo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring his protection or redoubting his proweſs; it ſeems as if he had need of the leaſt of his Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects; ſo ſenſible is he of their afflictions, ſo earneſt is he to offer 'em remedies, ſo favourable an ear does he lend to their ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plications.</p>
                  <p>This incomparable goodneſs ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends it ſelf to all conditions; the great receive every day Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimonies of it, the people every minute bleſs it, the domeſticks are charmed with it, and ſtrangers admire it. Of the two parts of juſtice, he leaves to the Parliament that which diſpoſes of the puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Crimes, reſerving only that which diſtributes recompen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces. He uſes his Authority only to reſtore, to repeal, to pardon. In fine, his power appears with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out bounds, when he is to do
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:46351:85"/>good; and it ſeems, as if it were without Authority, when it is to puniſh. The Refuſal of a favour is a Language unknown to him, and his Cloſet as well as his Heart, is always open to the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrances which is made him in behalf of the miſerable.</p>

                  <p>I take notice in the praiſes you now made, you have ſpoken only to the advantage of men, and not one word of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendation to thoſe of my Sex. I believe it is I that hinder you, but if I ſhut your mouth herein, methinks <hi>Cleonice</hi> ſhould open it.</p>

                  <p>Well then, for the love of her I will open it. I'le praiſe a celebrated Beauty whom all the Court admires; and <hi>Cleo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nice</hi> will have the pleaſure to ſee one part of her Charms, in the piece which I ſhall ſet forth.</p>
                  <p>Yet <hi>Dorante</hi> could better than I acquit himſelf in this affair,
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:46351:86"/>he knows the Author that drew the Picture; and the Lady for whom he wrought. But what ought I not to undertake to reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver your favours, I will ſatisfie you then, Madam, and recite word for word the little work I pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mis'd, provided my Memory will give me leave. Here's in what terms the Painter addreſſes him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to the Beautiful Lady whoſe Picture he drew.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>You know, Madam, that ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Beauties go only to the Painters to ſeek ſome new Charms, or to get rid of ſome Defects. You only, Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam, are above Arts which flatter and embelliſh. They have never wrought on you but unfortunately, and in making you loſe as many advantages, as they are wont to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtow on Perſons leſs accompliſh'd than you. But if you are little ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged to Painting, you are leſs to dreſſes. You owe nothing to the Sci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of others, nor to your own In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duſtry,
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:46351:86"/>and you may ſecurely remit your ſelf to Nature, ſhe having ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken ſuch exceſſive Care of you. Moſt Women are handſom only from the Dreſſes they uſe. What they put on ſerves to hide their Defects, whereas on the contrary, whatever you put off diſcovers ſome new Charm.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>I ſhall not give you any general and common praiſe. The Sun will no more furniſh me with a Compariſon for your Eyes, than the Flowers for your Complexion. I might ſpeak of the regularity of your Face, and ſymmetry of every part of your Body. But I perceive, beyond the obſervati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons I have made, there are a thouſand things to think, which cannot be expreſt, and a thouſand things which are better felt than thought on.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>You have collected in your ſelf the divers Charms of different Beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties. That which ſurpriſes, which pleaſes, which flatters, which touches, which ſharpens. Such a one has reſiſted a diſdainful Beauty, which
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:46351:87"/>has yielded to a delicate one; and delicacy may give diſguſt to Lovers who like only to ſubmit to diſdain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs. You only, Madam, know how to charm all the world: The paſſionate find in you the ſubject of their tranſports. Different ſpirits, divers humours, contrary tempers, all are ſubject to your Empire.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>The charms of your Converſation are not a whit inferiour to thoſe of your Face. One is no leſs affected with hearing you than ſeeing you. You can create a paſſion for you, though vail'd. Never was ſo much Politeneſs ſeen as in your diſcourſes, nothing ſo lively, nothing ſo juſt, nothing ſo happily thought. In fine, Madam, what one may ſay, after one has examined you, is, That there is nothing ſo unfortunate as to love you, nor nothing ſo difficult as not to love you.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Having ended this Recital, <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemon</hi> continued to ſpeak in this manner.</p>
                  <pb n="163" facs="tcp:46351:87"/>
                  <p>I ſee that <hi>Eraſtus</hi> is ready to dye with impatience to inſult o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver me. His Eyes tell me, that what I now gave out for a Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture, repreſents nothing in parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular, the whole being but a ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral deſcription, an heap of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions which an Author would have paſs for exquiſite ones.</p>

               <sp>
                  <speaker>Eraſtus.</speaker>
                  <p>Fear not that I ſhall com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain for not having ſeen in this deſcription, a certain reſemblance which you made me hope for: It belongs leſs to me, than the Lady who expected it to make you reproaches. Had you been as good as your word, <hi>Cleonice</hi> would have had the pleaſure of believing her ſelf handſomer than ſhe is, and I the vexation of finding her more diſdainful. This is a buſineſs that is between you and her.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Philemon.</speaker>
                  <p>It is plainly ſeen you would ſet us at odds; but <hi>Cleo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nice</hi> may eaſily diſtinguiſh in my
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:46351:88"/>recital; <hi>The regularity of her Face, and ſymmetry of every part of her Body.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Moreover I would fain know to whom may be better appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, what I ſaid of Converſation, and Politeneſs? Muſt I declare openly that it was of <hi>Cleonice</hi> that I ſpake?</p>

Let him proteſt if he will, that this is on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to practiſe the maxim we ſpeak of, and that he inſerted theſe indirect Commendations, only to praiſe in an ingenious manner.

                  <p>It is obſerv'd, that of late, <hi>Timagenes</hi> has a particular love for <hi>Berenice.</hi> He was notably ſet upon for it at <hi>Celyſire</hi>'s, even to the putting him almoſt out of countenance. But in fine, being aſhamed of his confuſion, he took courage, and with an aſſured tone thus ſpake. Is it any marvel, ſays he, that I ſhould love a moſt amiable Lady? Shew me any Snow whiter, or any Roſe of a more lovely colour than her com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexion? <hi>Berenice</hi>'s Eyes are Black, great, well ſet, and temper'd with ſuch ſweetneſs, and yet ſo ſpark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, that the room ſhe ſits in ſeems to be on fire with 'em. Her
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:46351:89"/>mouth is ſmall, well ſhaped, her lips Scarlet, which as ſoon as a ſmile opens them, you ſee the fineſt Teeth in the world.</p>
                  <p>I added immediately, that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing could be truer than what <hi>Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>magenes</hi> had ſaid of <hi>Beliſe.</hi> Of <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſe,</hi> ſaid he briskly, the reſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blance of the names deceive you, it is of <hi>Berenice</hi> that I ſpeak. So much the worſe for your Eyes, replied I, with a tone of aſſurance, it is not the conformity of names, it is the praiſes you give to <hi>Bere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nice</hi> which have made me believe you rendred juſtice to <hi>Beliſe.</hi>
                  </p>

                  <p>I would not interrupt you as ſoon as I ought. The Company it ſeems muſt remark after what manner you give prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, whether true or falſe; beſides I have not the ſtrength to make you ſilent immediately, for I am a woman, and you give me fine words.</p>

                  <p>I ſhall never hear any
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:46351:89"/>diſcourſe of praiſing, but I ſhall remember an Elogium which a friend of <hi>Dorante</hi>'s made for the King. Two Shepherds ſpake therein, one an <hi>Italian,</hi> whom I ſhall call <hi>Thirſis,</hi> the other a <hi>German,</hi> to whom I ſhall give the name of <hi>Menalca.</hi> Their Chara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cter was as different as the Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius of their Nation. <hi>Thirſis</hi> lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved ingenious Arts and Reſt. <hi>Menalca</hi>'s inclinations lay only for War; and his greateſt delight was in a tumultuous Life. They came to <hi>France</hi> only to ſee a King who fill'd all the Earth with his Name. After they had conſidered him with great admiration, they look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on one another, and immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately knowing one another to be ſtrangers, they accoſted, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired the occaſion of their Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vels. They had no ſooner un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood it, but this conformity of deſign made 'em continue their Converſation: But I know not
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:46351:90"/>whether I ſhould make them to relate in wretched Proſe, what they moſt ingenuouſly expreſs'd in verſe.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Dorante.</speaker>
                  <p>Your Proſe is well worth my Friend's Poetry; only go on.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Cleonice.</speaker>
                  <p>I will tell you then in few words; that <hi>Thirſis</hi> was aſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh'd how the King could ſo ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily govern a great Kingdom, as a Father of a Family rules his Houſe. He admired the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom ſhould be ſo flouriſhing, and in ſo good order, even as <hi>Menal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ca</hi> admired the Diſcipline obſerv'd in the Armies. When the <hi>Ita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lian</hi> acknowledg'd that <hi>Paris</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded <hi>Rome</hi> for fine Arts and Painting, Buildings and Muſick; the <hi>German</hi> was charm'd to ſee with what exactneſs all that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpected the Military Art was ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved. He ſaid there were ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver any braver Troops, never a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny better pickt men, better clad,
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:46351:90"/>better arm'd, and more willing to ſerve. If <hi>Thirſis</hi> muſed at Court on a King extraordinary well ſhaped, Equitable, Magnificent, Wiſe, Merciful; <hi>Menalca</hi> could not be tired in praiſing the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies of a Vigilant Prince, Inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fatigable and Intrepid. In fine, not to engage my ſelf farther into a diſcourſe, whence I cannot, perhaps, eaſily extricate my ſelf, I ſhall content my ſelf in telling you, that the two Shepherds ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinately diſputed; that they could not agree, and that in their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt, they publiſh'd all the King's Virtues both Civil and Military.</p>

                  <p>It is then the Elogium of a Victorious Prince which I under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take,

                  <p>This Author writes to the Prince after the winning of a conſiderable Battel, and makes him certain re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaches, and forms a kind of Quarrel, in a manner, infinitely more agreeable than the moſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular Congratulation. You may judge by ſeveral paſſages which I remember.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>How joyful I am, my Lord, to be at a diſtance from your High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, that I may the better ſay what I have long ſince thought of you. I dared not declare it, leſt I ſhould fall into the inconveniencies, wherein I have beheld Perſons who had taken the like Liberties. But, my Lord, you do too much to be paſt over in ſilence, and you will be unjuſt, if performing the Actions you do, it remained there, and no men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:46351:92"/>were made to you of 'em. If you knew in what manner all the world talks of you, you would be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoniſh'd to ſee with how little fear of diſpleaſing you they ſpeak of what you have done. In truth, my Lord, I know not what you have thought of, for it was a great boldneſs in you to have at your Age topt two or three old Captains, whom you ought to reſpect, if it were only for their Age. To have taken ſixteen pieces of Cannon which belonged to a Prince who is the King's <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ncle, and the Queen's Brother, with whom too you never had any difference. To have put into diſorder the beſt</hi> Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh <hi>Troops who ſo kindly let you paſs. All this is contrary to good manners, and matter enough, I think, for your Confeſſor. I have heard in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed that you were obſtinate, and that it was not good contending with you, but I did not think you would have been tranſported ſo far, and if you continue, you will render your

<pb n="173" facs="tcp:46351:93"/>the tour of a gallant man, whoſe inclinations, you'll find, led him to liberality.</p>
                  <p>I doubt not but you have heard that <hi>Voiture</hi> was a great Gameſter, and that he loſt in one day 1400 <hi>Lewis</hi>'s at the deceaſed Monſieurs, where he had the Office of intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducer of Embaſſadors Being an honeſt man as well as a man of wit, he would ſend away the next morning the Sum he had loſt; and finding at home only 1200 <hi>Lewis</hi>'s, he ſent to demand 200 of <hi>Coſtar</hi> his intimate friend. Send them to me ſpeedily, wrote he to him, you know I play no leſs on your credit than mine own. If you have them not, borrow 'em: If you find no body that will lend 'em you, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ell all that you have even to your good friend Monſieur <hi>Vauquet.</hi> For I muſt not fail of having 200 <hi>Piſtols.</hi> You ſee with what imperiouſneſs my friendſhip ſpeaks, the reaſon
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:46351:94"/>is becauſe it is vehement. Yours would ſay, I entreat you to lend me 200 <hi>Lewis</hi>'s, if you can with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out putting your ſelf to any incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venience; I beg your pardon that I ſhould be ſo free with you.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Coſtar</hi> ſent the 200 Piſtols, and anſwered, he never believed he could have ſo much pleaſure for ſo little money. Seeing you play on my credit, ſays he, I will al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways keep a ſtock to preſerve it. I can moreover aſſure you that a near Kinſman of mine has always a 1000 <hi>Lewis</hi>'s as much at my diſpoſal as if they were in your Coſſer. However I would not hereby expoſe you to any conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable loſs. One of my neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours told one yeſterday, that his loſt <hi>Pecunia</hi> would have prov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the beſt friend in the world to him, could he have kept him by him, and I adviſe you to keep yours. I ſend you back your Note
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:46351:94"/>but am ſurpriſed you ſhould deal thus with me, having taken ſuch a different courſe with Monſieur <hi>Balſac.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I will add then, that <hi>Balſac</hi> ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving need of money, ſent to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treat <hi>Voiture</hi> to lend him 1200 <hi>Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers,</hi> and charged the Porter to give him a Note for the like Summ: <hi>Voiture</hi> told the Money, and took the Note, wherein were theſe words.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>I underwritten confeſs to owe to Monſieur</hi> Voiture <hi>the Summ of</hi> 400 <hi>Crowns which he has lent me for,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Voiture</hi> takes the Note, and ſubſcribes theſe words.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>I underwritten confeſs to owe to Monſieur</hi> de Balſac, <hi>the Summ of</hi> 800 <hi>Crowns, for the pleaſure he has done me in borrowing of me</hi> 400.</p>
                  <p>After this, he gives the Note to Mr. <hi>Balſac</hi>'s <hi>Valet de Chambre</hi> to carry to his Maſter.</p>
                  <pb n="176" facs="tcp:46351:95"/>
                  <p>The Company was very well ſatisfied with this Recital, and could not but entertain them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves with it all the Supper time.</p>
                  <p>Scarce were they riſen from Table, but <hi>Cleonice</hi> reaſſumed the diſcourſe; I am charmed, ſaid ſhe, with the contents of <hi>Voi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture</hi>'s Obligation written under that which <hi>Balſac</hi> ſent him.</p>

However, ſeeing our conduct is ſo greatly concern'd in it, we will further deliver our o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion about it.

                  <p>Do you think it eaſie to know what we are, and of what humour the Perſons are before whom we ſpeak; to know

                  <p>I acknowledge it's hard to judge of the diſpoſition wherein the Perſons are that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe an aſſembly. The greateſt part of Mankind makes it a kind of merit to be always on its Guard, and to conceal its inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. Beſides, mens humours change; health is not always the ſame; Ambition, Love, and diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent Intereſts inſpire different In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clinations. But, Madam, it is not neceſſary that our know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge ſhould reach to the hearts of Perſons, and that we ſound in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the depths of their Souls, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they be ſuch in effect as they appear to be. It is ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent we know what their rank is, that we may have the deference for 'em that is due; and that we conſider what their capacity is; that we may not ſpeak too bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:46351:97"/>before abler Folks than our ſelves. It's true, that theſe refle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions are not ſufficient, we are obliged to remember our ſelves. What would you think, if a little young Gentleman, tho' born in <hi>Wales,</hi> ſhould draw his Chair, and ſit jig by joul with a Duke or Marqueſs; or interrogate in a fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliar tone with a Marſhal of <hi>France?</hi>

                  <p>There are people whom another ſort of Vanity blinds. You knew <hi>Clitandre,</hi> he was the Son of a mean Citizen, and an Office which he held under the King, was not more conſiderable than his Extraction. Yet he was well enough received by per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons of the greateſt Quality, and it was his Converſation that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cur'd him this admittance. I may likewiſe ſay, that he would have extreamly pleas'd, had he but re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membred what he was; But he ſhew'd more Vanity than Wit in
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:46351:98"/>his diſcourſes and behaviour. One day being at a Princeſſes, where there were none but Perſons of great Rank, he addreſt himſelf to ſome old Lords, who were Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernours of Provinces, or the King's Lieutenants of Countries, and talk'd to them of <hi>Verſailes,</hi> as one would ſpeak of <hi>Japan</hi> to perſons that had never ſeen the Map. You cannot believe, ſaid he to them, how great the Charms are which fix us to the Court, maugre the fatigues and perils we may meet there. I pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs our Life is a real Navigation, that we are toſt about, behold e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very day wracks, and are uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain whether the Waves will drive us into Port, or run us on a Rock. Judge in what aſtoniſhment was the Company. They look'd on one another, they ſmiled, and fail'd not to demand of <hi>Clitandre</hi> news from <hi>Verſailes,</hi> with as much ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtneſs, as when our Ambaſſador
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:46351:99"/>arriv'd from <hi>Siam.</hi> In fine, his preſumption ſo blinded him, That the Company grew weary of hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him and bearing with him a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny longer.</p>

                  <p>I have a Neighbour that is no ways inferiour to your <hi>Clitandre?</hi> She is wife to an Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficer under the King, whoſe place is too mean to be known: This Neighbour comes often to work with ſome Work-women whom I have employed to work me a Bed. Some four Months paſt I found her more melancholy than ordinary, and I ask'd her the reaſon. How, Madam, ſaid ſhe, with the greateſt ſurpriſe imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable, do not you know that the King ſets out to Morrow for <hi>Lux<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>embourg,</hi> and that my Husband is oblig'd to follow him. To ſpeak freely, added ſhe ſighing, the women of the Court are very unhappy, they pay dear in certain occaſions, for the honour

                  <p>Yes, Madam we take pleaſure to deceive our ſelves. It ſo ſeldom happens that our opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions be as juſt as they ought to be; that our hearts are therewith
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:46351:100"/>irritated, and makes us ſecret re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaches of it. And therefore it is that we dare not make too ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere reflections on the things which put us out of humour; and if on the contrary, we be ſo ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied with our ſelves to ſet chear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully on this examination, we fall into a Vanity which is more in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tollerable than the Ignorance of our ſelves can be.</p>

                  <p>But why ſo much ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tilizing to know exactly what we are, and the perſons before whom we are oblig'd to ſpeak; when the matter concerns only the due Decorum we ought to obſerve to one another. If we meet with Perſons of a conſiderable Rank, or extraordinaty Merit, do we not naturally fear to diſpleaſe them? And does not this fear lead us to teſtifie to 'em the deference we owe them? Do we feel any repugnance in yielding them the moſt Honourable, or Commodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:46351:100"/>place? In ſtopping to let them go in or out, in directing our words to them before the reſt of the Company, in ſhewing Complaiſance for their Sentiments, or at leaſtwiſe in not directly oppoſing them, if they prove con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to ours?</p>

                  <p>I imagine that it is more eaſie to keep this Deco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum and Character of Diſcretion with Perſons that are our Inferi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ours, than with thoſe to whom we are oblig'd to ſubmit. Our hearts are imperious, they ſuffer not over patiently that any Law ſhould be impoſed on them; but perhaps they are generous e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough to lay only eaſie ones.</p>

He would needs live no longer after this misfortune; he fitted a Rope to his Neck, and faſtned it to a Beam of his Chamber, and throwing himſelf in a fury off the Chair he ſtood on, by miſhap he threw that
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:46351:109"/>down, which made ſuch a noiſe that the people underneath came running up and beheld this Spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctacle, and a Neighbour cut the Rope to ſave, if poſſible, this Wretches life. In ſine, he was ſo carefully plied with proper reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, that his life was recovered againſt his will. Endeavours were alſo uſed to compoſe his mind, and a certain Almanack was pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced that promiſed ſuch ſtorms of Hail as would deſtroy all the Corn in the Fields. But he fell again into diſquiet, when he was told in what manner he was pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerv'd. Nothing would ſerve his turn but that his Rope ſhould be paid for, and knowing that his Neighbour laught at his folly, he got a warrant for him to bring him before a Juſtice to ſatisfie for the damage he did him in cutting his Rope.</p>

I ſet before him, that if he lived, he would be recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſed; and that if he hapned to dye, he would find—You be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, perhaps, I told him that he would find honour; not at all, but that he would find an end of his expences, which a man is obliged to make during the courſe of his life. Our Miſer reſolved upon it, but when he was to buy Horſes, and provide the reſt of his E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quipage, he ſoon renounc'd War; he told me he had rather retire to an Eſtate he had near <hi>Paris,</hi> and that he could ſubſiſt on an hundred things, whence Farmers drew a profit, which he pretend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:46351:110"/>not to let them have. To turn him from this deſign, I of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered to make a Campaign with him at Sea, if he were willing to go; And he needed no Horſes nor Tents for this; and the Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains Table being at his Service, he conſented thereto, and we ſet out. It's not neceſſary to relate to you what our Naval Army did, I ſhall only tell you, that at our return, we found our ſelves at <hi>Provence</hi> in the beginning of Winter. We would needs enjoy the fine time of that Country, and therefore made a match of walking out with Ladies. One day as we walk'd in a Path ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated from a Meadow by a Ditch; we thought that this ſeparation was not great enough to hinder us from leaping to the other ſide, and enjoying a nearer Converſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion with the Ladies. Our Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſer, being accuſtomed to ſparing, was ſo ſparing of his ſtrength, that
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:46351:111"/>he leap'd into the Ditch. The Ladies burſt out into a fit of loud Laughter, and I made what haſte I could to aſſiſt my Kinſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man. I ſtoop'd as low as I could to draw him out thence, bidding him only give me his hand; this word affrighted him more than his fall; and looking earneſtly upon me, what would you, an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered he me immediately, have me to give you? At theſe words I obſerv'd the fault I had com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted, and explaining my ſelf in a manner more conformable to his inclination; Couſin, replied I, ſhall I give you my hand? With all my heart, anſwered he, dear Couſin; and having offered his, I drew him out of the Ditch, where I believe he would have ſtill lain had I not chang'd the expreſſion.</p>

                  <p>I know a woman who has a great deal of wit, and talks well when there is no mention of Sickneſs or Remedies. But ſhe gives very good diverſion, as ſoon as the Converſation turns on mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters relating to health. I was ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſomething to her yeſterday a bout her Husband, who is a very honeſt Gentleman, and after ſhe had allowed his good qualities, ſhe added, that he had one bad one, which ſhe could not cure him of; which is, ſays ſhe, that he is ſo obſtinate that he will take no Remedies? But why ſhould he take any, replied I, if he be well? How, ſaid ſhe, do you think it
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:46351:112"/>enough to be in health, without taking Remedies for preventing diſtempers which you may fear?</p>
                  <p>In fine, when this imaginary ſick body takes Medicins, ſhe taſtes it then, and ſays there is too much <hi>Sena</hi> in one, too much <hi>Rhubarb</hi> in another, juſt as we find fault with Broths being too hot or too cold. Her Phyſician in ordinary dyed not long ago, and her friends fixt another on her of a humour ſo frank and brisk, that inſtead of preſcribing Remedies to her, he did her the diſpleaſure to tell her, that ſhe was in good health. She fell in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a paſſion, and anſwered ſmart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to this honeſt Doctor, that if he would order her nothing, ſhe knew where to find out others that would. The next morning ſhe choſe one, who regales her e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very morning with different Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicines to her content. It's not above three or four days ago
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:46351:112"/>that I was at her Houſe, and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted my ſelf with hearing her talk of the ſeveral ſort of diſeaſes ſhe fear'd, and their particular Remedies. Her friends do never fail to ſend to know of her health, and a Lacquey of <hi>Amaſia</hi>'s being come on the ſame Errand; you may tell your Lady, anſwered ſhe, with a languiſhing Air, that I thank her for her mindfulneſs of me, but that my health is loſt, there falling a cold humour on my left ſhoulder which puts me to grievous pain. This Lacquey was no ſooner gone, but we ſaw the Princeſs <hi>Demarata</hi>'s Gentleman enter; he made ſuch another ſort of Compliment, but he had a different anſwer made him. I pray you, Sir, ſaid our fanciful Lady, to let the Princeſs know how ſenſibly I find my ſelf ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged to her, tell her that a grievous pain in my head has hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred me ever ſince yeſterday
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:46351:113"/>from taking any reſt. As ſoon as ever this Gentleman was gone, I look'd on the pretended ſick body with amazement. Is your diſtemper gotten up into your head within this minute, ſaid I to her briskly, or have you forgot that it is not a moment paſt that your illneſs was in the left Shoulder? Did I ſay it was in my Shoulder, anſwered ſhe? Nothing more true, replied I; it's no matter, added our fancyful Lady, provided I ſaid I was troubled with ſome great illneſs, it's enough, I need ſay no more.</p>

Have you not a thouſand times obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved the continual perplexity of one of theſe Wantons, how to dreſs her ſelf, and to keep all ſhe thinks ſhe has acquired? She ſpeaks to one, looks on the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond, and ſmiles on the third. This Theam is ſo large, that it is ſufficient to deter a man that has talk'd enough already. I dare no more inſiſt on the Rail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leries which one might make of jealous Perſons. I ſhall content my ſelf in telling you, that theſe laſt Fools are yet more ridiculous than others. They never fail to
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:46351:114"/>form imaginary Subject of their frenzy, when they cannot find any real. They ſee nothing in the Objects which they behold through their jealouſie, but what may relate to this paſſion, as we ſee all things yellow when we have the Jaundiſe. An Husband that takes notice his Wife is careleſs of her ſelf, thinks he is not lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved by her; and if ſhe dreſſes, then 'tis to pleaſe others. I ſhould never have done, ſhould I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribe all theſe follies.</p>
                  <p>It's ſufficient to ſay, that a jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous Perſon poiſons every thing, and that inſtead of favourably in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpreting things, for to ſet his heart at eaſe, he gives every thing ſuch a conſtruction as may en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe his diſquiet.

                  <p>We have already ſaid, that if they do it, it muſt be finely and delicately, and to make the Converſation more a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeable.

                  <p>A certain Perſon of <hi>Paris</hi> whom I ſhall call <hi>Liſicrates,</hi> had nothing but what was obſcure in his birth and his life. However, a Son he had being gone into <hi>Italy</hi> very young, had got a great Eſtate at <hi>Rome,</hi> and ſent wherewithall
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:46351:116"/>make plenty reign in his Family. The Father died, and a Nephew to whom he had left a good Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, ſet up immediately for a Spark. It came into one of my Friends head to abaſe his pride, and to ſhew him that his Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly was ſtill obſcure enough not to be known in its own Country. He found him in a company where the Converſation turn'd upon News. My friend was ask'd what he knew, becauſe he was a perſon of good intelligence; he told them what was talk'd of at <hi>Verſailles,</hi> and paſſing afterwards to Foreign Countreys, he report<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with an Artificial Tone, <hi>That the Letters from</hi> Rome <hi>inform us that</hi> Liſicrates <hi>is dead in this Town.</hi>

You may judge of him by his Quibbles. An Abbot, who had perhaps more Ambition than Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit,
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:46351:122"/>would needs pretend to be made a Cardinal. He went to <hi>Rome</hi> for this purpoſe, but having taken wrong meaſures, he return<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed little ſatisfied with his Voyage.

But as to us who have a different relliſh, we will allow our ſelves this liberty; and when any Hiſtory or Tale may ſerve to recreate the auſterity of Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts, or make us more exact and cautious, we will gladly en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertain it. Thus being inſtructed, if we are to make a Truce for eight days, we will take ſuch meaſures as not to be deceived, we will expreſs that it ſhall be
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:46351:124"/>for eight natural days of twenty four hours, wherein the nights ſhall be comprehended. But inſtead of troubling our ſelves with ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtifying our citations, it's enough to alledge that they pleaſe us; and if <hi>Philemon</hi> has any ſcruple hereupon, let him ſend it to ſome muſty Pedant, and let him be pleaſed with us, as heretofore. I am ſo ſure that he will be ſo, that I will reaſſume the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe where it was broke off.</p>
                  <p>Here's an equivocal word which heretofore ſurpriſed the whole world; or rather, here's a ſubtle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of extraordinary conſequence. You know, that of the <hi>Scipio</hi>'s there were two that bore the name of <hi>Affrican;</hi> that the firſt vanquiſh'd <hi>Hannibal,</hi> and that the other deſtroyed <hi>Carthage.</hi> This laſt, the better to ſubdue Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies who were ſo terrible to the <hi>Romans,</hi> made uſe of an Equivo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation,
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:46351:125"/>or rather of a diſtincti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on which you will not find wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy of ſo great a man. The <hi>Carthaginians,</hi> finding themſelves too weak to hold out long, offered to capitulate and ſurrender their Town; and <hi>Scipio</hi> promis'd them there ſhould be no hurt done to their City. But ſcarce was he Maſter of it, but he cauſed the Fortifications of it to be deſtroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. The <hi>Carthaginians</hi> cried out, that the Faith of the Treaty was violated; but for all that, <hi>Scipio</hi> failed not to level their Walls and Towers.</p>
                  <p>He endeavoured afterwards to juſtifie himſelf, and ſhew that he had not broke his word. He re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſented to the <hi>Carthaginians,</hi> that the <hi>Romans</hi> did not confound the names of Town, and City. That the Body of the Citizens formed the City, and that the Walls and other Edifices compoſed the Town. That he ſhould have been diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſed
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:46351:125"/>had the Inhabitants been ill treated; but more diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſed, had he left the Walls and Fortifications entire, which could be of no uſe, but only to raiſe a Jealouſie in the <hi>Roman</hi> People.</p>

                  <p>The <hi>Athenians,</hi> fearing to be beſieged, and ſubjected by the <hi>Perſians,</hi> conſulted the Oracle on the Reſolution they were to take; it was anſwered, That the City muſt depart the Town, and ſave it ſelf by wooden Walls. So that it was interpreted, that the Citizens ſhould abandon a Town, which was not ſtrong enough to ſecure them; and that they ſhould get on board their Ships, to flie from the danger wherewith they were threatned.
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:46351:126"/>There is no body in this Room, but has heard talk of <hi>Paris</hi> in this double Senſe. When we mean the Town, we ſay that <hi>Paris</hi> is every day embelliſhed; and when we ſpeak of the Inhabitants, the Body of which makes what the Ancients called City; we ſay, That all <hi>Paris</hi> is walking in the Park; That all <hi>Paris</hi> is gone in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Country in the beginning of Autumn.</p>

<pb n="246" facs="tcp:46351:131"/>and fear'd above all, leſt his paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, which he felt ſo violent in its beginning, would lead him, in fine, to the ſatisfying his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires, to the prejudice of his For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune.</p>
                  <p>He reſolved to baniſh from his Soul ſo dangerous a tenderneſs, he oppoſed it all he could; and finding he could not immediately overcome it, he called in a ſenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Glory to the aſſiſtance of his Reaſon.

                  <p>You will not be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt my making a diſtinction on what you demand. Should I be thought able to give good ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, and a Manuſcript were put into my hand before it went to the Preſs, I would ſpeak ingenu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly what I thought of it; and ſhould think my ſelf unworthy the confidence put in me, did I deal in another manner.</p>
                  <p>Thus you ſee, I am not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways ſo complaiſant as you have taken me to be. I will tell you too moreover, that it is not long ſince that an Author found me as untractable in matter of Sonnets, as <hi>Moliere</hi>'s Miſanthropos. He ſhewed me one full of <hi>Antitheſes,</hi> wherein a Lover complained of the death of his Miſtreſs; I could not bear with all his juglings, and impatiently interrupting the Read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er; how, Sir, ſaid I to him, will you have this man amuſe him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf in ſporting with words, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead
<pb n="256" facs="tcp:46351:136"/>of bewailing his misfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune? This is ſo beſide the ſubject, that I doubt I ſhall not have pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience enough to hear it out to the.</p>

                  <p>Let me tell you a ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of a young Author, who came from a <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 span">

                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap> before he expoſed his Book to be conticis'd by the publick. This Country Author would by no means yield to this at firſt, thinking this ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice fruitleſs for a Poem which had been approved in his Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, but at length he permitted himſelf to be led to <hi>Chapelain,</hi> ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parently to acquire eſteem for it, rather than to admit of correcti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. He told him he came to ſhew him an Epic Poem he had made
<pb n="257" facs="tcp:46351:136"/>at home, and that he would glad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly hear ſo great a Maſter's opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on on his Work. To ſpeak free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, anſwered <hi>Chapelain,</hi> you are to be commended for having un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertaken ſo difficult a work at your Age, and in a Country ſo far from all aſſiſtance, which one might have at <hi>Paris.</hi> Sir, repli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Author, I will dedicate this Poem to the Mareſchal <hi>d'Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bret.</hi> You cannot make a better choice, replied the complaiſant <hi>Chapelain,</hi> the Mareſchal is a man of wit, and he is Governour of your Province. You will be near a <hi>Mecenas,</hi> who will relliſh your Writings, and give you his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection. After theſe words the Manuſcript was opened, and the young Wit read about 50 or 60 Verſes. This beginning was wide, and had no coherence with the Subject, ſo that <hi>Chapelain</hi> telling him, I ſee, Sir, you have thought fit to treat of things at firſt in
<pb n="258" facs="tcp:46351:137"/>general, to deſcend afterwards in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to particulars which more cloſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly relates to your Subject. Ah! Sir, cried the young man, what ſatisfaction there is in conſulting a perſon like you, you know al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready the ſcope of my Poem, as well as if I had read it all to you.</p>
                  <p>No ſooner was this ſaid, but people came in, the lecture broke off, and our Author went out. He was ſo well pleaſed with the Viſit he made, that turning him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf towards him that had introdu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced him, you muſt acknowledge, ſaid he to him briskly, that no firſt Book had ſo great ſucceſs; I do not ſee how, anſwered his Friend, you can ſay that a Poem has ſucceeded before it comes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad into the world, unleſs you do as the Marqueſs <hi>Moliere</hi> ſpeaks of, who lik'd the Play before the Candles were lighted. To ſpeak ſincerely, Monſieur <hi>Chapelain</hi> has too great indulgence, and if you
<pb n="259" facs="tcp:46351:137"/>will be ruled by me, we will con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſult ſome one that has leſs.</p>
                  <p>They then went to the Abbot <hi>d'Aubignac,</hi> and after the accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtomed Civilities were paſt, the young man told him that he had made an Epic Poem. So much the worſe, replied the Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bot briskly, for I am ſure you know not what an Epic Poem is, ſeeing that at your age you ſet about a thing which the moſt conſummate Learned Men dare not undertake. This boldneſs ſhews me better than your ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent from what Country you come. But, Sir, replied the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor, with aſtoniſhment ſufficient, I compoſed this Work only to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicate it to the Marſhal <hi>d'Albret</hi> You could not worſe addreſs your ſelf, replied the Abbot. Do not you know that the Marſhal <hi>d' Albret</hi> is one of the fineſt Wits we have? That he loves to rally, and that he will laugh at you and your Poem? He be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="260" facs="tcp:46351:138"/>Governour of our Province— For this very reaſon, replied im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patiently the Abbot, you ought not to lay your ſelf open to him, and expoſe your ſelf to be the laughtngſtock of your Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, but, Sir, replied again the young man, you ſpeak of faults, without having ſeen any, hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, if you pleaſe, and you may better judge afterwards; he took then immediately a Sheet, and read it, without allowing the Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bot ſo much time as to interrupt him. But before he came to the ſixth Verſe the Abbot <hi>d'Aubignac</hi> being tyred with hearing it, ſaid with ſome ſharpneſs to him, I would gladly know, Sir, ſays he, whether this be the beginning of a work of Piety or of a prophane piece, of an Hiſtory or Fable? But, Sir, a little more patience, till I—Pray tell me not of patience, anſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Abbot, <hi>Virgil,</hi> who per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps knew as well as you the
<pb n="261" facs="tcp:46351:138"/>Rules of an Epic Poem, ſays im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately, that he ſings the great actions of that Hero who came firſt from the <hi>Trojan</hi> Shores into <hi>Italy.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The young Author, being as it were Thunder-ſtruck, goes to <hi>Chapelain</hi> to comfort himſelf. Sir, ſaid he to him, I am lately come from the moſt intollerable Critick in the world, who is the Abbot <hi>d'Aubignac,</hi> who would not ſo much as ſuffer me to read ſeven or eight Verſes of my Work. He told me my beginning was not worth a ſtraw, and that it had no relation to the Subject. I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, anſwered <hi>Chapelain,</hi> that Monſieur the Abbot <hi>d'Aubinac</hi> is not wholly in the wrong; but however, the buſineſs is not paſt remedy, you can make another beginning, and keep that of your Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>em for the firſt Work you ſhall make.</p>

                  <p>I like this management of beginnings, and I find no leſs agreeable this oppoſition of an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſive

                  <speaker>Philemon.</speaker>
                  <p>I did not believe <hi>Chapelain</hi> of this humour, and I have had a very different account of it, from that which <hi>Eraſtus</hi> gives us. I was told that the deceaſed Count <hi>de Fieſque,</hi> coming from the Play, met <hi>Chapelain,</hi> and told him he had been greatly diverted with the ſight of a Play he na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med him. Is it poſſible, Sir, an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered him <hi>Chapelain,</hi> that ſo great a man as you, and who has ſo great wit, can behold with pleaſure a Comedy wherein the Characters are not upheld, wherein the Actors come and ſpeak, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out knowing why, nor how; and, in fine, wherein there's not the obſervation of the leaſt Rule? The Count was for re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viewing the ſame piece with a greater application. He conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed better of it, and went afterwards to <hi>Chapelain,</hi> pray, ſays he to him,
<pb n="263" facs="tcp:46351:139"/>reſtore me my ignorance, I was greatly diverted with the Play be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, but now I take no delight in it.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Dorante.</speaker>
                  <p>It is certain, that for our ſatisfaction, it is neceſſary we ſhould behold ſometimes the Plays on the Theatre with indulgence. Can a man divert himſelf with <hi>Harlequius</hi>'s Emperor of the Moon, if in entring he leaves not his ſound ſenſe and Rules at the Door?</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Philemon.</speaker>
                  <p>Hereunto we may add, as I have already ſaid, that it is dangerous being too complai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant, or too ſevere in the advices one gives. The Abbot <hi>d'Aubignac</hi> was perhaps the occaſion of the young man's leaving <hi>Paris</hi> and his Studies; and on the other hand <hi>Chapelain</hi> might induce him to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply himſelf thereto with too great negligence, and without ſucceſs.</p>
                  <p>They enlarg'd themſelves no farther on this ſubject, and the company judg'd it late enough to depart. <hi>Eraſtus, Philemon, Cleo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nice,
<pb n="264" facs="tcp:46351:140"/>Beliſe,</hi> and <hi>Lindamire</hi> went out, and return'd home.</p>
                  <p>A ſmall time after <hi>Dorante</hi> and <hi>Liſidor</hi> ſupt, and ſtill entertain'd themſelves on the care which was to be obſerv'd in reprehending and criticiſing in Company.</p>

                  <p>I believe a man ſhould be leſs haſty to anſwer, when his advice is askt in relation to man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, and the ordering of ones life. Beſides the preſumption we ſhew, when we give over haſtily theſe kind of advices, it ſeems as if we were ſure of the Event, and that we may be juſtly reſponſible, when the ſucceſs anſwers not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation. So that we muſt let others ſpeak, eſpecially if they have more experience than we, and let us not give in our opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions before we are askt more than once. If we be oblig'd to anſwer, let it not be too affirma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively, let us modeſtly utter the reaſons which uphold our opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
<pb n="265" facs="tcp:46351:140"/>and ſhew we not in our Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenances, nor Diſcourſes, an air of Conſidence, which may make us appear full of our ſelves. I know you are not of an age to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſulted, and there is little likelyhood that Old Men will need your ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, but young Perſons may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire it, and others too hereafter. Moreover I do not keep ſtrictly to the giving you preciſely the Precepts ſuitable to you; it will do you no hurt to know others, to the end that minding the perſons who obſerve them, you will come the better to know the World. I doubt not but you are ſatisfied with the Company you have ſeen, they are extraordinarily well hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour'd and ingenious. You have taken notice how free they are, and remote from all conſtraint and affectation; you have ſeen nothing but what's eaſie, na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural, and ingenious in what they ſay; it is this Air you muſt imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate,

Your principal de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign is to pleaſe in the Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation of the World, let's therefore ſee what may contribute to this Deſign.</p>
                  <p>It is a great advantage to have
<pb n="267" facs="tcp:46351:141"/>a gallant Air, but it is an advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage which a Man can acquire but imperfectly by his endeavours. Nature muſt begin it in us, and we muſt afterwards cultivate theſe favourable diſpoſitions. We may polliſh them, and perfect them by frequenting perſons who have already this Air, if we imitate them in their Converſation, and manner of behaviour.</p>

               <sp>
                  <speaker>Liſidor.</speaker>
                  <p>Is it not ſufficient to pleaſe in Converſation, that we are able by our good <hi>Meen</hi> to give weight and reliſh to our words?</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Dorante.</speaker>
                  <p>A good Meen alone does not always produce this good effect; we ſee every day Country People, who are well ſhaped and of a good aſpect, and yet are in no wiſe agreeable company. The Air I ſpeak of, is the Soul of a good <hi>Meen;</hi> without this Air, it is very difficult to pleaſe; it is this gallant and polite Air, which ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
<pb n="268" facs="tcp:46351:142"/>every thing pleaſing. It's ſeen on the Countenance, in Diſcourſe, Cloaths, at Table, Houſe-hold-ſtuff, Equipage, and even in Buildings. Moſt young People ſtrive to out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>do one another in Gallantry, but they are leſs gallant than they think for. They do not mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate themſelves enough, and their heat makes 'em carry things too far. The air of Politeneſs we ſpeak of requires ſweetneſs, and young people have I know not what that is brisk, which does not agree with the Character of a gallant man. You have obſerv'd that they are commonly too haſty in taking up what is neweſt in Modes, and that they ſeldom fail of going be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond the bounds which a gallant man ſhould preſcribe. Inſtead of a well contriv'd ſuit, they are for laying on the heavyeſt Lace or Embroidery they can get. If they give a Treat, they proceed to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs, and for their Equipage they
<pb n="269" facs="tcp:46351:142"/>are not contented with what's neat and fit, they add more Splendour than their Quality or Eſtate re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires. They think of nothing but diſtinguiſhing themſelves here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by, far from regulating their ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence by their Revenue.</p>
                  <p>Neither muſt a man, to render himſelf agreeable in Converſation, utter only ſubtle things, or out of the common Road. It is not ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to ſhew a great ſtock of Learning, and a vaſt deal of Wit. It is ſufficient to ſpeak with an eaſie air, and that nothing ſavours of affectation and conſtraint, as I have already recommended to you more than once. I was very glad that you ſaw ſo ſoon <hi>Cleonice, Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſe</hi> and <hi>Lindamire.</hi> The two firſt have a very ingenious manner, which may contribute to make you get the ſame air and the ſame tour. you will never part from them without profitting either in your Underſtanding or Will.</p>
                  <pb n="270" facs="tcp:46351:143"/>
                  <p>You will meet with few wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men whoſe Converſation is more agreeable, you may get by them ſuch an air, as the reading of the beſt Authors; nor the moſt learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Conferences will never afford you. I likewiſe confeſs that I am not diſpleaſed at your ſeeing of <hi>Lindamire;</hi> it is natural for you to wiſh to pleaſe her, and it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be, having this deſign, but that you muſt endeavour to polliſh your mind, to make your humour ſweet and inſinuating, in a word, to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire the qualities which may gain the eſteem of Ladies. Moreover, the deſire which one may have to touch the heart of a fine woman who has Quality and Merit, may ſerve as a preſervative againſt a diſorder wherein Perſons of your age do too often fall. Not that I pretend you ſhould bound your viſits to <hi>Cleonice,</hi> and that being ſo young you ſhould begin to ſigh in form for <hi>Lindamire.</hi> When
<pb n="271" facs="tcp:46351:143"/>you have made two or three Cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paigns, I will ask your ſentiments hereupon, and I will tell you mine. However, I muſt needs acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge to you, that I ſhould rather ſee you fixt on <hi>Lindamire,</hi> than any other perſon I know; but how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever I would not have this reſpect for her proceed ſo far as to hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der you from ſeeing other compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies, and to make thence your ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervations of different humours. However I do not mean you ſhould go from Houſe to Houſe, to flatter and make courtſhip to Ladies who will not be diſpleaſed with it. A man that makes this his buſineſs, will be ſo far from being reſpected as a gallant Perſon, that he will be accounted no bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter than an idle Fop.</p>
                  <p>Now as to ſuch directions as concern young men in general. Have you not obſerv'd they fall of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten into defects contrary to the manners of polite men? They
<pb n="272" facs="tcp:46351:144"/>laugh every moment ſo loudly that their laughter is in no ſort like the ſubtle ſmiles obſervable in the Converſation of polite per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons. They diſengage Friends to draw them into other Companies, and inſtead of living reſpectfully with Women, they imagine it the beſt breeding to uſe 'em fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliarly. That which I find ſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſt, is, that they ſometimes pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed to ſwearing, like the raſcal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly mean people.</p>
                  <p>And yet it is not difficult to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>void theſe faults, and I wiſh you at no greater trouble in attain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the fine Air we ſpoke of. You have all the diſpoſitions which can be deſired, and I hope you will cultivate them with ſucceſs.</p>

                  <speaker>Liſidor.</speaker>
                  <p>I have been an hundred times ſurpriz'd to hear ſay, that <hi>Melicrates,</hi> whom you know, is a polite Perſon, yet we all agree in our Country, that he is far from what we call politeneſs.</p>

                  <p>There is much diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence between a Man of great Air, and a man that has the Air great; and I add, that we muſt no more confound a gallant Man, with a Man gallant. The firſt has this Air gallant, ſo much talk'd of in <hi>France,</hi> and which anſwers in ſome ſort to the urbanity of the Ancient Romans; the other may without politeneſs be a Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans Gallant, or have an inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to Gallantry in general. An old Man may pleaſe by the qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of Gallant Man, but he would be ridiculous if he made Gallan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries in his old days.</p>

                  <speaker>Liſidor.</speaker>
                  <p>I ſuppoſe that when we ſay that ſuch a Man has a good Air, we praiſe him leſs, than if we attribute to him the Air great, or the Air Gallant.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Dorante.</speaker>
                  <p>You need not doubt of it, and it is likewiſe certain, that the good Air agrees differently to the two Sexes, to all ages, and all
<pb n="274" facs="tcp:46351:145"/>profeſſions. A Sword Man, has com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly an open and fierce Air, a Magiſtrate is grave; a Woman ſhould have ſweetneſs and mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty, but the Air great is the moſt rare; and ſometimes among ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Princes, we ſee few of 'em, whoſe <hi>Meen</hi> does denote the Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of his Rank. This is an advantage which we admire in the perſon of the great Monarch, to whom you ſhall be preſented, when I ſhall find you uſed to Coverſation, and the Manners of the Men of the World.

It is here that you will find more politeneſs and leſs

                  <p>It's true, they are like enough to one another, and they both pleaſe almoſt in the ſame manner. Yet what we call agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ableneſs is more general, it ſuits with more things, it inſinuates it ſelf more ſweetly, it reaches to the Heart and touches it. The Air gallant takes another courſe, it ſeizes on the Fancy, and gains e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteem; but to ſpeak in general, nothing can pleaſe in perſons who have not a good Air. It's true, that one may in ſome ſort obtain it, in being careful that ones acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on be free, and in acquiring a facility of ſpeaking.</p>

                  <p>Nothing is more op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſite to the Maxims of the civil Society than this Conduct, and a perſon who ſhall obſtinately fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low it, will be in danger of never getting Friends. All the Ancients have admir'd the eaſie humour of <hi>Alcibiades,</hi> and we ſtill wonder that a Man could ſo well accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modate himſelf to the different man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners
<pb n="292" facs="tcp:46351:157"/>of Countries where he lived. Nothing was ſo much talk'd of at <hi>Athens,</hi> as his Eloquence and Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lantry. Among the <hi>Perſians</hi> he was always feaſting, and nothing was ſeen more ſplendid than his Dreſs and Equipage. But he paſt over to other oppoſite Manners, when he was oblig'd to go to <hi>Sparta.</hi> The moſt rigid <hi>Lacede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monian</hi> led a Life leſs auſtere than his <hi>Pharnacius:</hi> It's certain, that <hi>Alcibiades</hi> was not content with following the diverſe Cuſtoms of Nations, but he moreover diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh'd himſelf by a more exact regularity in practiſing them.</p>

                  <p>We may regard the Conduct of this famous <hi>Greek,</hi> as a Complaiſance of Manners, if one may ſpeak thus. This is a quality which gains mightily on the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple. It is neceſſary for Perſons who travel, and are deſigned for Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſies; yet we may juſtly ſay, that this Complaiſance of action
<pb n="293" facs="tcp:46351:157"/>is neither ſo neceſſary nor of ſo frequent uſe as the complaiſance of words. We have every moment occaſions of yielding to the Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions of Perſons whom we have a deſign to pleaſe, and it ſeldom happens that we are obliged to quit our Modes and Cuſtoms, to take thoſe of Strangers.</p>

                  <p>Herein appears the addreſs of the men of the World.

                  <p>To return to our ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, we may ſay, that tho' we be Maſters of our humour, yet we
<pb n="294" facs="tcp:46351:158"/>muſt never abuſe this power, in betraying our Sentiments, in main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining an error, or in giving prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes to words or actions which do not deſerve it.</p>

                  <speaker>Pharnacius.</speaker>
                  <p>But if you follow your own opinion, if you praiſe only things praiſe-worthy, and you take no party which you can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not juſtifie by reaſons, what vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence do you offer your ſelf, and wherein do you appear Maſter of your humour?</p>

                  <p>When I ſacrifice it to that of others, when I renounce my own will to accommodate my ſelf to others, to whom I am wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to give tokens of my ſubmiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion. I will undertake a Journey which ſhall be propoſed to me, in a time wherein I would rather chuſe to lie ſtill; and I ſhall ſuffer my ſelf to be engaged in a ſplendid diver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſement, which will caſt me into an expence and trouble which I ſhould have been very glad to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>void.
<pb n="295" facs="tcp:46351:158"/>Thus my actions will ſhew the deference I have; my words, and even ſilence will give no ſmall tokens of it. If a Prince, whom I would not willingly diſpleaſe, commends an ill Man, that has diſoblig'd me, and whom he does not well know, I will overcome my reſentment, and add to a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of generoſity, a ſubmiſſion which will make me ſilent, when I cannot be of the ſame opinion of a perſon whom I will not offend.</p>

                  <p>It ſeems to me that it ſhould be chiefly to Women that a Man ſhould ſubject his humour, there being many Capricio's to be born from them. As the greateſt part among them do not ſtrive to be over Conſtant, ſo we do not make our Court right to them, if we do not change with them; yet ſee how far their lightneſs leads. It being to the handſomeſt among them to whom we chiefly endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to render our ſelves agreeable,
<pb n="296" facs="tcp:46351:159"/>from them therefore we muſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect to ſuffer moſt. Beſides, that they have no leſs inconſtancy, it is certain that the continual flatteries wherewith they are fed, make them generally more vain, and leſs equitable.</p>

                  <p>You well judge, Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam, that I will do what you pleaſe, yet you muſt permit me not to enter on particulariſing the errors which the Quietiſts follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</p>

                  <p>For thus were thoſe call'd who embraced this Sect. They drew this name from the Reſt they pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to enjoy when they had rais'd their Souls to contemplation by the means of a Prayer they reci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted. They held it was ſufficient for them to make an Act of Faith, and ſet themſelves in the preſence of God, and to rely wholly on his Providence. This was me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thinks a good way to draw a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundance of People; whether that being lazy they chuſe rather to yield themſelves up after this man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner that they may not act; or that they had the vanity to believe themſelves capable of well contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plating. If Women, as you now ſay, are not the Authors of He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſies, yet we ſee 'em ready enough to follow thoſe they are taught, as either being deſirous of new things, or ſuffering themſelves to be taken with the fine appearances wherewith the Errors which are
<pb n="308" facs="tcp:46351:168"/>propoſed be generally diſguiſed. However it be, ſeveral Perſons of your Sex followed the opinions of <hi>Molinos</hi> the chief of the Quietiſts. It is true this <hi>Spaniard</hi> paſſed for a Saint before he was diſcovered to be an <hi>Hereſiarch.</hi> You know, Madam, that he has abjured his Errors, and that he is ſhut up for the reſt of his life.</p>

Muſt it not be acknowledged that he who ſo well governs ſo vaſt a Machin, muſt needs be a wiſe and infinitely powerful Being; and if he be ſuch a one as we ſay, can we refuſe him our adorations? I would willingly know after what manner we ſhould regulate the worſhip which ſhould ſerve to te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtifie our acknowledgment and our ſubmiſſion? Muſt this be the fancy of ſome frantick <hi>Enthuſiaſt,</hi> or by the Pious Maxims of great and holy Perſonages which have been always in the Univerſal Church? This matter is too fine and large to be included in our Entertainments. Inſtead of en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaging our ſelves therein, it is ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient
<pb n="310" facs="tcp:46351:169"/>to make known to you in few words, that it is no hard mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to ſhut the mouths of the Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bertines, provided they prefer not their obſtinacy to the reaſons wherewith one may convince them.</p>
                  <p>However I would not have thoſe who maintain the right ſide to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear puft up with their advantages; they muſt ſpeak with good ſenſe, with reſpect, and without ſharp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and oſtentation.</p>

But when we are pleaſed to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe on the State under which we live, we ſhould never extend our conjectures too far, nor affect to appear too penetrating. You know nothing does more contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute to the happy ſucceſs of an
<pb n="315" facs="tcp:46351:171"/>enterpriſe, than the ſecrecy ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerv'd therein. The Captains themſelves whom the King chuſes to execute his deſigns, commonly know what they are going about, and learn it only by the Orders which they muſt not open, but at certain times, and in certain places. After ſuch exact precautions, can our affairs be mention'd with an affirmative tone? Dare we reaſon on uncertain conjectures? Perſons of good ſenſe never talk of theſe matters but with great modeſty, and for my part I can only for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>give this imprudence in Perſons who are incapable of making any reflexion. How many do we hear every day cenſuring that Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment which they do not under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand, they make War and Peace according to their Fancy, and wholly buſie themſelves in hearing News, and modelling the affairs of State, when their Families at home are perhaps ready to ſtarve for want of Bread.</p>

                  <p>It's true, that ſince the King has ſo conſiderably encreaſed his States, the Government is not ſo much ſpoke againſt.</p>

They affirm, that the Law, which requires the State to be Monarchical, and to be ordered in the manner we

<pb n="322" facs="tcp:46351:175"/>himſelf herein. We ſee it ſeldom happen, but that the preſumptive Heir of a Kingdom is Educated according to the Rank which he muſt one day poſſeſs. Such ſenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of Clemency and Equity are inſpired into him, as may con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribute to the Peoples happineſs; whereas the like Education is not beſtowed on particular perſons, who are too far diſtant from the Throne, to make it thought that they will one day poſſeſs it. Judge of the Factions which are form'd for an election of this importance; and into what wars theſe factions may draw the People. Theſe troubles are not fear'd in ſucceſſive King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms, therein happens no change. If a King dies, his Son takes his place, and ſeveral Reigns appear but one continued Reign.</p>
                  <p>It is not to be ſuppoſed, that only perſons remarkable for their virtues are choſen, and in whom there can be found no fault,
<pb n="323" facs="tcp:46351:175"/>ſeeing theſe perſons uſe all their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duſtry to diſſemble and hide their Vices, and to adorn themſelves with qualities becoming their am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition: But when they have got<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten their aim, and have nothing more to deſire or fear, they then throw off their masks, and aban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don themſelves to all manner of diſſoluteneſs. I could give a great many Examples of this, but you will find enough in the Roman Hiſtory, if you will take the pains to read it.</p>

                  <p>You ſee, <hi>Dorante,</hi> that I have reſerv'd the difficulteſt partion you, according to my mind, ſeeing it now lies upon you to tell us by what reaſons the <hi>Salic</hi> Law could exclude Women from ſucceeding their Fathers, and deprive them of what Nature allowed them.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Dorante.</speaker>
                  <p>It troubles me, Madam, that I am not ſo ſenſible of the honour you do me, and to tell you that the <hi>Salic</hi> Law had an
<pb n="324" facs="tcp:46351:176"/>admirable foreſight in this third part which you condemn. If this Kingdom ſhould fall into the Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minine Line, and we ſaw a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumptive Heireſs of the Crown, to what miſery ſhould we not be reduced? In effect, ſhould it hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen that the Princeſs would chuſe a Husband among her Subjects, thoſe who expect this honour, would make ſtrong Parties, and carry things to a greater extremity, than in Elective Countries, ſeeing the prize is no leſs than a Crown, which would paſs to their Deſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dants, and remain for ever in their Family. He that has the good for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune to be preferred, will be ſo unhappy as to be hated of his Rivals, the greateſt Men at Court, and who will never faithfully ſerve him. If on the contrary, the Heireſs of a Kingdom ſhould caſt her eyes on a neighbouring Prince, to beſtow on him her Heart, and her Scepter; we ſhould fall under
<pb n="325" facs="tcp:46351:176"/>the domination of a ſtranger, our Monarchy would become a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince of his States.</p>
                  <p>Thus, Madam, you ſee you have no reaſon to complain of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſtice done your Sex, you muſt rather think this was ordered for the beſt; ſeeing hereby is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented all thoſe diſmal Revolutions which I have now denoted to you.</p>

<pb n="326" facs="tcp:46351:177"/>I will be no leſs complaiſant, than you: I conſent that <hi>Dorante, Philemon,</hi> and <hi>Eraſtus</hi> tell us after what manner we ſhould ſpeak of Paſſions, Vices, and Virtues; and I offer to ſhew you afterwards, whether their Opinions be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formable, or contrary to thoſe I maintain.</p>
                  <p>The Company having laught at the pleaſantry of <hi>Cleonice,</hi> it was granted that there was no matter which oftner fell into Converſation, than that ſhe came from propoſing, ſo that it was reſolved on, that ſome time ſhould be ſpent in diſcourſing on that ſubject.</p>

                  <p>I can boldly ſay I un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand the juſtneſs which is found in an expreſſion, but I acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge I ſhould be puzzled to ſay wherein it conſiſts. <hi>Dorante</hi> can clear up this point.</p>

                  <speaker>Dorante.</speaker>
                  <p>I am perſwaded that what does moſt contribute to the juſtneſs of a diſcourſe is, when there happens a real relation, or a real oppoſition between the terms, and between the things which are put
<pb n="328" facs="tcp:46351:178"/>together. Thus I ſhould not ſpeak juſtly, ſhould I ſay that <hi>Liſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dor</hi> is of <hi>Provence,</hi> and <hi>Philemon</hi> an Officer of the Kings; ſeeing there is no relation, nor oppoſition be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween a Country and an Office. Neither ſhould I any more ſpeak juſtly, if being willing to teſtifie my acknowledgment to <hi>Cleonice,</hi> I ſhould explain my ſelf in theſe terms. I return Graces to a Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon who has 'em infinitely. This is properly what we may call a <hi>Galamathias,</hi> and it is very hard to underſtand two words which are tyed together without any relation. In effect, in the firſt place the word <hi>Graces</hi> ſignifies on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly thanks, and the other word which is underſtood, is only taken for ſome agreeableneſs of the Countenance, or of the Perſon. I might moreover give you infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite Examples on this defect of juſtneſs, but I ſhall content my ſelf with telling you, that it is
<pb n="329" facs="tcp:46351:178"/>chiefly in compariſons, where it is to be chiefly avoided.</p>
                  <p>I ſhould ſpeak ill, ſhould I ſay that the <hi>Barbe Iſabella</hi> of <hi>Phile<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon</hi> is as fine as the Diamond which <hi>Eraſtus</hi> wears, tho' it be permitted me to eſteem one as much as the other, and to offer an hundred <hi>Lewis</hi>'s for the Horſe as well as for the Ring. But we ſhould not compare the beauty of a Stone with that of an Animal, which is to ſay, two things which have neither any relation or oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition between them.</p>

                  <p>I found yeſterday <hi>Juve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal</hi> lying on one of my Friend's Table, I opened it, and 'twas exact<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly on a paſſage of his ſixth Satyr, where he ſpeaks of the manner after which the women of thoſe times coifed themſelves. He de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribes the bucklings and coiffings ſeveral Stories high which a wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton Dame wore, and ſays that her Size was ſo tall with them, that

And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we may ſpeak of the matter which <hi>Cleonice</hi> has giv'n us, and acknowledge in the beginning, that there is nothing ſo dangerous as the paſſions.

                  <p>It's true, that the greateſt part of the World regards Ambition, Love and Hatred as the Springs of all Evils, and it is commonly their violence which leads to the committing of the injuſtices which we ſee in the World.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Dorante.</speaker>
                  <p>We grant you that the impetuoſity of the paſſions hurries but too often to the committing of crimes, but can ſhe not like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe be of great uſe in the leading us to Heroick Virtue? Without Ambition we ſhould ſee no Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queror, hear nothing of <hi>Alexander</hi>
                     <pb n="332" facs="tcp:46351:180"/>nor <hi>Caeſar,</hi> and none of thoſe glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Actions would be perform'd which procure an immortal Repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation. So that inſtead of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demning the paſſions, I rather wiſh a good uſe were made of them, and that they were rendred profitable. We love the effects of Clemency and Compaſſion, we admire that which the love of Glory produces, and the ſequel of Infamy. And however decry'd Fear is, yet in a thouſand occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions ſhe makes up one part of Prudence. It is from her that we foreſee evils, and avoid them. What may we not moreover ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve, if we examine the other paſſions?</p>

                  <p>It ſeems to me that we have only the paſſion of Love to examine, there being ſcarcely any other but it. It takes diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent names according to the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference of its objects. Ambition is only the love of Greatneſs;
<pb n="333" facs="tcp:46351:180"/>Covetouſneſs the love of Riches; and Hatred, which appears ſo op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſite to Love, is, to ſpeak proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, only a diſguiſed Love; ſeeing we have only averſion for that which is offenſive to us, becauſe we love our own preſervation.</p>

                  <p>When we had only to explain what Love is, do you think we ſhould be without perplexity? Although it be ſo natural and gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral a paſſion among an infinite number of Perſons which feel it, you will find few that can tell you what it is. You may be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded of what I ſay by this Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſopher, who ſays that Love is I know not what, that comes from I know not where, and goes away I know not how.</p>

                  <speaker>Dorante.</speaker>
                  <p>We are ſo little accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtomed to enlarge our ſelves on the ſubjects we ſpeak of, and to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage our ſelves in ſubtilties which ſerve only to tire the mind, that I do not think we ought to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſs
<pb n="334" facs="tcp:46351:181"/>the nature of Paſſions. Thoſe who are minded to inform them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves farther, may read the works we have on this ſubject, and in the mean time content themſelves with the diſtinctions which we have promiſed to bring. It muſt be acknowledg'd that we are to blame in condemning the paſſions, and in being afraid of them. They are indifferent in themſelves, and if it happens they ſometimes di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſturb the tranquility of our life; there are other occaſions where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in they are of great help to us. Men without boldneſs, would they march to Glory through Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tigues and Dangers? Let's make another diſtinction, ſhall we call a man valiant who has done a great Action by an impetuoſity of boldneſs, and ſhall we accuſe of Cowardiſe a Perſon that a pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nick terror has ſeiz'd in ſome oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion? True Valour is when in
<pb n="335" facs="tcp:46351:181"/>every rencounter our Courage diſpoſes us to vanquiſh the obſtacles which oppoſe our deſigns; as a man muſt not paſs for a Coward, but when 'tis his cuſtom to avoid Danger. Thus we may reaſon on the other Vices, and on the other Virtues. A Magiſtrate is not to be praiſed as juſt, for having done juſtice once. To merit this com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendation, he muſt be in a firm and conſtant diſpoſition to render to every one what belongs to him.</p>

<pb n="337" facs="tcp:46351:182"/>than theſe two paſſions. E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mulation is lively and generous, and Envy baſe and malicious. The firſt is a regret at our ſmall deſert, the other a vexation which ariſes from the Merit of others. Emu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation would raiſe us, and Envy would abaſe what is above us. In fine, nothing is more worthy of our contempt than Envy, nothing is more commendable than Emu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation. It made <hi>Caeſar</hi> weep at the ſight of <hi>Alexander</hi>'s Picture, and hindred <hi>Themiſtocles</hi> from ſleeping near the Trophies of <hi>Mil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiades.</hi> You know what <hi>Caeſar</hi> and <hi>Themiſtocles</hi> afterwards exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted.</p>

                  <p>As to what regards Vices and Virtues, I would ſpeak differently of them, according to the different circumſtances there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to joyned.

                  <p>Every body does not regard it in the ſame manner, and I know not whether it will not puzzle us to ſay preciſely what it is. It's true there is a natural e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity which is generally appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved; but it is not leſs certain that
<pb n="339" facs="tcp:46351:183"/>it is diverſly practiſed. There never was any obligation more indeſpenſable, than that requiring Children to ſerve thoſe who brought them into the world, eſpecially when they are grown old, and find themſelves afflicted with diſeaſes. All the People of <hi>Europe</hi> obſerv'd ſo juſt a Maxim, and yet the <hi>Scythians,</hi> who poſſeſt more Country than <hi>Europe</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended, accuſed thoſe Children of inhumanity who let their Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents live under an incurable Malady. For their parts they gave the fatal blow as a ſtroke of Grace, and thought it juſt to terminate thus their Parents mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſery. They extended further their pretended Charity. They eat their bodies inſtead of burn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing or interring them, imagining nothing more Pious than to give this Sepulture to their Parents, for to change them into their
<pb n="340" facs="tcp:46351:184"/>proper ſubſtance, and make them live again in themſelves as far as it was in their power. Conſider this well.

                  <p>I think it more u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſual to diſtinguiſh the Vices and Virtues according to the profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions of Perſons, than according to the Cuſtoms of their Country. A Virtue renders us recommen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dable only according as it is ſui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table
<pb n="341" facs="tcp:46351:184"/>to us. A Perſon conſecrated to the Service of the Altar ſhould prefer the knowledge of Religion to all other Sciences, and his Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ety muſt be ſo great as to make his words and actions exemplary. A Souldier muſt gliſter after ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther manner, Valour ſhould be his Virtue; and what regards Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litary Diſcipline, or the Art of Fortification, ſhould be his chief ſtudy.</p>

                  <p>But can I not be told preciſely what this Virtue is in general, ſo much talkt of?</p>

                  <p>It is not an eaſy mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter wholly to ſatisfie you on this Subject, ſo diverſly has the virtue you ſpeak of been conſidered. I know not whether you will ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove of an Opinion which I find the moſt plauſible. I am perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded that this Virtue, of which we form ſo fine an Idea, and which is believ'd ſo proper to make us live
<pb n="342" facs="tcp:46351:185"/>happily, is properly what we call Juſtice.</p>

                  <speaker>Beliſe.</speaker>
                  <p>But is not Juſtice the particular virtue of Magiſtrates?</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Dorante.</speaker>
                  <p>It ſhould be the virtue of all People, and had we all that ſtock of Equity neceſſary for the commerce of life, we ſhould need neither Law nor Magiſtrates. Men would render what-ever they are obliged to render, and they would begin by the Woriſhp due to God. Subjects would obey their Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raigns, Children their Parents, and as no body would claim what does not belong to him, there would be no Mention of Thefts nor Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers; even detraction would be baniſht all Societies.</p>

You ſee I diſcover my defects to you, and that I am not exempt from Malice, nor an Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my to pleaſant Relations. It's true, there are very few Stories that pleaſe me. If it be an ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venture, I would have it ſurpri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing; if the News reſpects only thoſe ready and lively anſwers which we call pleaſant Repartees, I require a great delicateneſs in the tour of expreſſion.</p>

                  <p>I know not, Madam, whether there be News which may in particular, be called in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructive, but I may ſay that all News in general may become inſtructive, when they are related by an able man. He can render the circumſtances thereof uſeful for manners, for the adminiſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of affairs, for the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of People, and for the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering of Armies. If a Siege or Battel be ſet forth to us in their proper colours, we ſhall obſerve the defects or the good conduct of the Generals, and thence make our advantage. If we be told of the conſternation wherein the <hi>Ottomans</hi> were, we ſhall ſee that we muſt lay aſide Pleaſures, when buſineſs requires a conſtant attendance. We ſhall accuſe <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>homet</hi> IV. of blindneſs, in going
<pb n="350" facs="tcp:46351:189"/>to divert himſelf in hunting, when he ſhould be at the head of his Armies.</p>
                  <p>We ſhall obſerve that things are generally preſerv'd by the ſame means as they were acquired, that Valour is neceſſary to keep a So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veraign on the Throne; that Cowardiſe draws only the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt and indignation of the Sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diery and Subjects.</p>

                  <p>We can add nothing to what was ſaid on this matter by a great Magiſtrate, whoſe Learning and Eloquence has long ſince been admired by all the World.

<pb n="352" facs="tcp:46351:190"/>have dealt in a different manner at <hi>Rome,</hi> towards the Embaſſador of the Eldeſt Son of the Church, the moſt <hi>Chriſtian</hi> King, a Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narch whoſe Predeceſſors have protected and defended the Holy See.</p>

                  <p>Will you believe me, inſtead of wading farther into this matter, do as I have done, buy the Book we have already hinted at, read it more than once, and you will have the pleaſure of profiting by the labours of a great man who knows more of it than we ſhall ever know.</p>

                  <p>We need not doubt thereon; for when we are told with what dexterity a jealous or

                  <p>It's true, there are People who have no other buſineſs.

                  <p>A News-monger can anſwer all queſtions; if he has any knowledge in Maps, and the intereſts of Princes, he may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn probable anſwers, otherwiſe he pays for his boldneſs.
